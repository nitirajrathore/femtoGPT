the report of our Statutory Auditors, set out in the section titled ‗Financial Statements‘ beginning on page 

187 this Draft Prospectus. Our restated financial statements are derived from our audited financial 

statements prepared in accordance with Indian GAAP and the Companies Act, and have been restated in 

accordance with the SEBI (ICDR) Regulations.  

Our fiscal year commences on April 1st of each year and ends on March 31st of the next year. All 

references to a particular fiscal year are to the 12 month period ended March 31st of that year. In this Draft 

Prospectus, any discrepancies in any table between the total and the sums of the amounts listed are due to 

rounding-off. All decimals have been rounded off to two decimal points. 

There are significant differences between Indian GAAP, IFRS and US GAAP. The Company has not 

attempted to quantify their impact on the financial data included herein and urges you to consult your own 

advisors regarding such differences and their impact on the Company‘s financial data. Accordingly to 

what extent, the financial statements included in this Draft Prospectus will provide meaningful 

information is entirely dependent on the reader‘s level of familiarity with Indian accounting practices / 

Indian GAAP. Any reliance by persons not familiar with Indian Accounting Practices on the financial 

disclosures presented in this Draft Prospectus should accordingly be limited. 

Any percentage amounts, as set forth in ―Risk Factors‖, ―Our Business‖, ―Management‘s Discussion and 

Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations‖ and elsewhere in this Draft Prospectus unless 

otherwise indicated, have been calculated on the basis of the Company‘s restated financial statements 

prepared in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Companies Act, Indian GAAP and restated 

in accordance with SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, as stated in the report of our Peer Reviewed Auditor, set 

out in the section titled ‗Financial Statements‘ beginning on page 187 of this Draft Prospectus.

currency of the Republic of India. All references to ―$‖, ―US$‖, ―USD‖, ―U.S. $‖or ―U.S. Dollars‖ are to 

United States Dollars, the official currency of the United States of America. 

All references to ‗million‘ / ‗Million‘ / ‗Mn‘ refer to one million, which is equivalent to ‗ten lacs‘ or ‗ten 

lakhs‘, the word ‗Lacs / Lakhs / Lac‘ means ‗one hundred thousand‘ and ‗Crore‘ means ‗ten million‘ and 

‗billion / bn./ Billions‘ means ‗one hundred crores‘. 

INDUSTRY & MARKET DATA  

Unless otherwise stated, Industry & Market data used throughout this Draft Prospectus have been 

obtained from internal Company reports and Industry publications inter alia Corporate Catalyst (India) 

Private Limited, India Budget, United Nations Industrial Development Organisation etc. Industry 

publications generally state that the information contained in those publications has been obtained from 

sources believed to be reliable but their accuracy and completeness are not guaranteed and their reliability 

cannot be assured. Although we believe that industry data used in this Draft Prospectus is reliable, it has 

not been independently verified. Similarly, internal Company reports, while believed by us to be reliable, 

have not been verified by any independent sources. 



 

Page 15 of 371 
 

Further the extent to which the market and industry data presented in this Draft Prospectus is meaningful 

depends on the reader‘s familiarity with and understanding of the methodologies used in compiling such 

data. There are no standard data gathering methodologies in the industry in which we conduct our 

business, and methodologies and assumptions may vary widely among different industry sources.

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This Draft Prospectus contains certain ―forward-looking statements‖. These forward looking statements 

can generally be identified by words or phrases such as ―aim‖, ―anticipate‖, ―believe‖, ―expect‖, 

―estimate‖, ―intend‖, ―objective‖, ―plan‖, ―project‖, ―shall‖, ―will‖, ―will continue‖, ―will pursue‖ or other 

words or phrases of similar meaning. Similarly, statements that describe our strategies, objectives, plans 

or goals are also forward-looking statements. All forward looking statements are subject to risks, 

uncertainties and assumptions about us that could cause actual results and property valuations to differ 

materially from those contemplated by the relevant forward looking statement. 

Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations include, but are 

not limited to the following:- 

• General economic and business conditions in the markets in which we operate and in the local, 

regional, national and international economies; 

• Changes in laws and regulations relating to the sectors/areas in which we operate; 

• Increased competition in the sectors/areas in which we operate; 

• Factors affecting chemical Industry; 

• Our ability to meet our capital expenditure requirements; 

• Fluctuations in operating costs; 

• Our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; 

• Changes in political and social conditions in India, the monetary and interest rate policies of India and 

other countries; 

• Inflation, deflation, unanticipated turbulence in interest rates, equity prices or other rates or prices; 

• The performance of the financial markets in India and globally;  

• Any adverse outcome in the legal proceedings in which we are involved; 

• Our failure to keep pace with rapid changes in technology;  

• The occurrence of natural disasters or calamities;  

• Other factors beyond our control;  

• Our ability to manage risks that arise from these factors;and  

• Changes in government policies and regulatory actions that apply to or affect our business.  

For a further discussion of factors that could cause our actual results to differ, refer to section titled ―Risk 

Factors‖ and chapter titled ―Management‘s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results 

of Operations‖ beginning on pages 17 and 231 respectively of this Draft Prospectus. By their nature, 

certain market risk disclosures are only estimates and could be materially different from what actually 

occurs in the future. As a result, actual future gains or losses could materially differ from those that have 

been estimated. 

Future looking statements speak only as of the date of this Draft Prospectus. Neither we, our Directors, 

Lead Manager, Underwriters nor any of their respective affiliates have any obligation to update or 

otherwise revise any statements reflecting circumstances arising after the date hereof or to reflect the 

occurrence of underlying events, even if the underlying assumptions do not come to fruition. In 

accordance with SEBI requirements, the LM and our Company will ensure that investors in India are 

informed of material developments until the grant of listing and trading permission by the Stock 

Exchange

RISK FACTORS 

An investment in Equity Shares involves a high degree of risk. Prospective investors should carefully 

consider all the information in this Draft Prospectus, particularly the ―Our Business‖ ,―Financial 

Statements as Restated‖ and related notes, and ―Management‘s Discussion and Analysis of Financial 

Condition and Results of Operation‖ on page 146 ,187 and 231 respectively of this Draft Prospectus and 

the risks and uncertainties described below, before making a decision to invest in our Equity Shares. 

Any of the following risks, individually or together, could adversely affect our business, financial 

condition, results of operations or prospects, which could result in a decline in the value of our Equity 

Shares and the loss of all or part of your investment in our Equity Shares. While we have described the 

risks and uncertainties that our management believes are material, these risks and uncertainties may not 

be the only risks and uncertainties we face. Additional risks and uncertainties, including those we 

currently are not aware of or deem immaterial, may also have an adverse effect on our business, results 

of operations, financial condition and prospects. 

This Draft Prospectus contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our 

actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a 

result of certain factors, including the considerations described below and elsewhere in this Draft 

Prospectus. 

The financial and other related implications of risks concerned, wherever quantifiable, have been 

disclosed in the risk factors below. However, there are risk factors the potential effects of which are not 

quantifiable and therefore no quantification has been provided with respect to such risk factors. In 

making an investment decision, prospective investors must rely on their own examination of our Company 

and the terms of the Issue, including the merits and the risks involved. You should not invest in this Issue 

unless you are prepared to accept the risk of losing all or part of your investment, and you should consult 

your tax, financial and legal advisors about the particular consequences to you of an investment in our 

Equity Shares. 

Unless otherwise stated, the financial information of our Company used in this section is derived from 

our audited financial statements under Indian GAAP, as restated. 

Materiality 

The Risk Factors have been determined on the basis of their materiality. The following factors have been 

considered for determining the materiality: 

1. Some events may not be material individually but may be found material collectively 

2. Some events may have material impact qualitatively instead of quantitatively 

3. Some events may not be material at present but may be having material impact in future 

The risk factors are classified as under for the sake of better clarity and increased understanding:

Internal Risk Factors 

 Business Specific / Company specific Risk 

1. Adverse fluctuations in the price and availability of raw material could increase input costs which 

may affect the operations of the Company and thereby affect the profitability of the Company. 

The Company imports major of its present raw material from China. Any adverse change in the 

prices and availability of raw material in future may have an impact on the price competitiveness if 

the Company may not be in a position to pass on such price rises to its customers. 

2. There are no supply agreements for the major raw materials with our vendors/suppliers. Our 

Business may be adversely affected if there is any disruption in the raw material supply or due to 

non availability of raw material. 

We do not have written agreements with our vendors/suppliers and operate on a purchase order 

system. Due to the absence of any formal contract with our vendors/suppliers, we are exposed to the 

risks of irregular supplies or no supplies at all and delayed supplies which would materially affect 

our results of operations. 

In the event of any disruption in the raw materials supply or the non availability of raw material from 

alternate source, the production schedule may be adversely affected impacting the sales and 

profitability of the Company. 

3. We do business with our customers on purchase order basis and do not have long-term contracts 

with most of them. 

Our business is conducted on purchase order basis, depending on the requirements of the client 

preferences and demand. We do not have long-term contracts with most of our customers and there 

can be no assurance that we will continue to receive repeat orders from any of them, including our 

long-standing customers. Further, even if we were to continue receiving orders from our clients, 

there can be no assurance that they will be on the same terms, and the new terms may be less 

favourable to us than those under the present terms. 

4. The company is dependent on a few number of customers and derives 41.98% of total revenues 

from top 10 customers for the period ended January 31, 2016. Loss of any of these large 

customers and inability of the Company to replace these customers will adversely affect the 

revenues and profitability of the Company. 

The Company derived 41.98 % of its total revenues from 10 major customers for the period ended 

January 31, 2016 and is dependent on them for its revenue. The inherent nature of Chemicals and 

Dyestuff business includes selling a sizeable part of the production to a single or major customers. 

Also, save for market dynamics of prices, the demand from these sources is consistent. However, 



 

Page 19 of 371 
 

such consistency in demand cannot be guaranteed in the future and hence may impact the 

profitability of the Company. 

5. We require high working capital for our smooth day to day operations of business and any 

discontinuance or our inability to acquire adequate working capital timely and on favorable terms 

at a future date, may have an adverse effect on our operations, profitability and growth prospects 

Our business demands substantial funds towards working capital requirements. In case there are 

insufficient cash flows to meet our working capital requirement or we are unable to arrange the same 

from other sources or there are delays in disbursement of arranged funds, or we are unable to procure 

funds on favourable terms, at a future date, it may result into our inability to finance our working 

capital needs on a timely basis which may have an adverse effect on our operations, profitability and 

growth prospects. 

Summary of our working capital position is given below:

6. Ours is a High Volume-Low Margin Business 

Our Company is into the growing phase of business cycle. Our inability to regularly grow our 

turnover and effectively execute our key business processes could lead to lower profitability and 

hence adversely affect our operating results, debt service capabilities and financial conditions. Due to 

the nature of the products we sell, we may not be able to charge higher margins on our products. 

Hence, our business model is heavily reliant on our ability to effectively grow our turnover and 

manage our key processes including but not limited to raw material procurement, timely sales / order 

execution and continuous cost control of non core activities. For the period ended on January 31, 

2016 and for the financial year 2014-15, 2013-14 and 2012-13 our revenue was Rs. 4863.17 lakhs, 

7418.52 lakhs, 6934.71 lakhs and 4456.08 lakhs respectively. Our Profit before Tax Margin and 

Profit after Tax Margin were lower than 0.51% for each period. As part of our growth strategy, we 

have already initiated steps for increase our revenue of operations, and cater to wider markets. Our 

growth strategy is subject to and involves risks and difficulties, many of which are beyond our control 

and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to implement our strategy or growth 

plans, or complete them within the timelines. For further details regarding the discussions and 



 

Page 20 of 371 

 

explanations for our past results, please refer to the chapter titled ―Management‘s Discussions and 

Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations‖ on page 231 of this Draft Prospectus. 

7. Any penalty or action taken by any regulatory authorities in future for non-compliance with 

provisions of corporate and other law could impact the financial position of the Company to that 

extent.  

Our Company has not strictly complied with certain provisions of the Companies Act, 1956 and the 

Companies Act, 2013 such as Provisions of Sec 185 of Companies Act, 2013, Sec 58A or Sec 73 of 

Companies Act 1956 or Companies Act, 2013 respectively, non/delayed filing of forms, creation of 

charge, etc. Although no show cause notice have been issued against the Company till date in respect 

of above, in the event of any cognizance being taken by the concerned Registrar of Companies in 

respect of above, penal actions may be taken against our Company and its directors, in which event 

the financials of the Company and its directors may be adversely affected. 

8. If we are unable to source business opportunities effectively, we may not achieve our financial 

objectives.  

Our ability to achieve our financial objectives will depend on our ability to identify, evaluate and 

accomplish business opportunities. To grow our business, we will need to hire, train, supervise and 

manage new employees and to implement systems capable of effectively accommodating our 

growth. However, we cannot assure you that any such employees will contribute to the success of 

our business or that we will implement such systems effectively. Our failure to source business 

opportunities effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition 

and results of operations. It also is possible that the strategies used by us in the future may be 

different from those presently in use. No assurance can be given that our analyses of market and 

other data or the strategies we use or plans in future to use will be successful under various market 

conditions. 

9. The Company is prone to public liability claims as it deals in hazardous products / chemical, 

liabilities incurred if any, as a result of an untoward event have the potential to materially impact 

the financial position of the Company. 

The company involves dealing with various toxic chemicals which are hazardous to environment. 

Occurrence of any accident during storage, loading, unloading, transport activity may leads to 

damage of assets, stock, premises and life. Such incidences may lead to unforeseen costs and the 

Company may have to compensate for any losses or damages suffered by third parties as a result of 

such incidents. 

10. We are dependent upon the growth prospects of the industries, where end product made by using 

our product is used. 

Our Company falls in to trading of speciality chemicals , Basic Chemicals whose products have 

substantial demand from varied industries and their sub-sectors We thus cater to the requirements of 

these industries and any slowdown in the growth rate or downward trend in any of these industries 

directly or indirectly impact our own growth prospects and may result in decline in profits and 

turnover of sales. 

11. Compliance with, and changes in, safety, health and environmental laws and regulations may 

adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations 

Due to the nature of our business, we expect to be or continue to be subject to extensive and 

increasingly stringent environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and various labour, 

workplace and related laws and regulations. We are also subject to environmental laws and 

regulations, including but not limited to: 

a. Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 



 

Page 21 of 371 
 

b. Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 

c. Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 

d. Hazardous Waste Management & Handling Rules, 2008 

e. Other regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and the Pollution 

Control Boards of the state of Gujarat. 

which govern the discharge, emission, storage, handling and disposal of a variety of substances that 

may be used in or result from the operations of our business. 

The scope and extent of new environmental regulations, including their effect on our operations, 

cannot be predicted and hence the costs and management time required to comply with these 

requirements could be significant. Amendments to such statutes may impose additional provisions to 

be followed by our Company and accordingly the Company needs to incur clean-up and remediation 

costs, as well as damages, payment of fines or other penalties, closure of production facilities for non 

compliance, other liabilities and related litigation, could adversely affect our business, prospects, 

financial condition and results of operations. 

12. Delay in transferring/obtaining approvals from concerned authorities may adversely affect our 

business.  

We were a private limited company in the name of ―Yash Chemex Pvt. Ltd.‖ which was carrying on 

chemical trading business of dyes, pigments, resins and others. As per Companies Act, 2013, a 

private limited company can be converted into public limited company. After complying with the 

relevant procedure of Companies Act, 2013 the said private limited company was converted into a 

public limited company. We have applied for certain approvals which are still in the name of private 

limited company. We shall be taking necessary steps for transferring the approvals in name of our 

company. In case we fail to transfer/obtain the same in name of the company same may adversely 

affect our business or we may not be able to carry our business. 

13. Our warehouses are not owned by us. In the event, we are unable to renew the lease/rent 

agreements, or if such agreements are terminated, we may suffer a disruption in our operations. 

Our godowns are taken on lease of varying tenures. These leases are renewable on mutually agreed 

terms. Upon termination of the lease, we are required to return the said business premises to the 

Lessor/Licensor, unless renewed. There can be no assurance that the term of the agreements will be 

renewed and in the event the Lessor/Licensor terminates or does not renew the agreements on 

commercially acceptable terms, or at all, and we are required to vacate our offices, we may be 

required to identify alternative premises and enter into fresh lease or leave and license agreement. 

Such a situation could result in loss of business, time overruns and may adversely affect our 

operations and profitability.  

For details on properties taken on lease/rent by us please refer to the heading titled ―Properties‖ in 

chapter titled ―Our Business‖ beginning on page 146 of this Draft Prospectus. 

14. Our indebtedness and the conditions and restrictions imposed by our financing arrangements 

could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and operations. 

We have entered into agreements with certain banks and financial institutions for short-term and 

long-term borrowings. Some of these agreements contain restrictive covenants, including, but not 

limited to, requirements that we obtain written consent from lenders prior to issuing new shares, 

incurring further debt, creating further encumbrances on our assets, effecting any scheme of 

amalgamation or restructuring, undertaking guarantee obligations, declaring dividends, undertaking 

new projects or making investments. There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with 

these covenants or that we will be able to obtain the consents necessary to take the actions we believe 

are required to operate and grow our business. Certain of our loans may be called at any time by our 



 

Page 22 of 371 

 

lenders pursuant to terms of the relevant agreements. An event of default under any of these loan 

arrangements, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on us. 

15. Our lenders have imposed certain restrictive conditions on us under our financing arrangements.  

Under our financing arrangements, we are required to obtain the prior, written lender consent for, 

among other matters, changes in our capital structure, formulate a scheme of amalgamation or 

reconstruction and entering into any other borrowing arrangement. Further, we are required to 

maintain certain financial ratios. Further Our Company has not received ―No-Objection‖ certificate 

from our lenders to undertake this Issue. Non receipt of such ―No Objection‖ certificate could lead to 

non compliance of the terms of loan agreements entered into by our Company with said lender. There 

can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with these financial or other covenants or that we 

will be able to obtain the consents necessary to take the actions we believe are necessary to operate 

and grow our business. Our level of existing debt and any new debt that we incur in the future has 

important consequences. Any failure to comply with these requirements or other conditions or 

covenants under our financing agreements that is not waived by our lenders or is not otherwise cured 

by us, may require us to repay the borrowing in whole or part and may include other related costs. 

Our Company may be forced to sell some or all of its assets or limit our operations. This may 

adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and impair our future growth plans.  

Further, as on the date of the Draft Prospectus, we have not received ―No Objection‖ certificates from 

the lender, YES Bank. We cannot assure you that the lender will grant us the ―No-Objection‖ 

certificate for this Issue. Non-receipt of such ―No Objection‖ certificate could lead to non-compliance 

of the terms of loan agreements entered into by our Company with them. For further information, see 

the chapter titled ―Financial Indebtedness‖ on page 240 of the Draft Prospectus. 

Though these covenants are restrictive to some extent for us, however it ensures financial discipline, 

which would help us in the long run to improve our financial performance.  

16. We have taken unsecured loan of Rs. 204.90 Lakhs as on January 31, 2016 which is repayable on 

demand. In case of untimely demand, we will have to arrange these funds which may carry higher 

cost of funding, which may have an impact on our financial operations. 

We have taken unsecured loan of Rs. 204.90 Lacs as on January 31, 2016 which can be recalled at 

any time and in that event, it may affect the financial operations of our Company to that extent. 

17. Our lenders have charge over our properties in respect of finance availed by us. 

We have secured our lenders by creating charge over our properties. In the event we default in 

repayment of the loans availed by us and any interest thereof, our properties may be forfeited by 

lenders. For further information on the financing and loan agreements along with the total amounts 

outstanding; please refer to section titled ―Financial Statements as Restated‖ of our Company‖ on 

page 187 of this Draft Prospectus. 

18. Our dependence on imported raw materials may affect our profitability. We are also subject to risks 

arising from exchange rate fluctuations. 

We majorly meet our raw material requirements by procuring them from international markets. Our 

dependence on imports may adversely affect our profitability in case the trade relations of India with 

any of countries from where raw materials are imported get strained in future or the suppliers face any 

sort of problems due to internal issues of producing countries. 

Also significant exchange rate fluctuations may affect our Company's business as it may alter the 

costs of the imports significantly. The exchange rate between the Rupee and other currencies is 

variable and may continue to fluctuate in future. Fluctuations in the exchange rates may affect the 

Company to the extent of cost of goods rendered in foreign currency terms. Any adverse fluctuations 



 

Page 23 of 371 
 

with respect to the exchange rate of any foreign currency for Indian Rupees may affect the 

Company‘s profitability. 

19. The Promoter Group of our Company does not include Harshadbhai Shah, Geetaben Shah, 

Ketulbhai Shah, Gargiben Shah, Kalaben Shah, Rupalben Shah, Smitaben Shah and Hansaben 

Shah and/or any entity(ies) in which these persons may have an interest. 

The Promoter Group of our Company does not include certain relatives of our Promoters, namely, 

Harshadbhai Shah, Geetaben Shah, Ketulbhai Shah, Gargiben Shah, Kalaben Shah, Rupalben Shah, 

Smitaben Shah and Hansaben Shah and/or any entity(ies) in which they severally or jointly may have 

an interest. They have refused to provide any information pertaining to them or any such entities. A 

declaration has been provided by the Promoters excluding the above person/entities from Promoter 

Group. Apart from the said declaration, there are no formal disassociation arrangements between 

them. 

20. Our Promoter directors have provided personal guarantees to certain loan facilities availed by us, 

which if revoked may require alternative guarantees, repayment of amounts due or termination of 

the facilities. 

Our Promoter Directors have provided personal guarantees in relation to certain loan facilities availed 

by us. In the event that any of these guarantees are revoked, the lenders for such facilities may require 

alternate guarantees, repayment of amounts outstanding under such facilities, or may even terminate 

such facilities. We may not be successful in procuring alternative guarantees satisfactory to the 

lenders, and as a result may need to repay outstanding amounts under such facilities or seek additional 

sources of capital, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all and any such failure to 

raise additional capital could affect our operations and our financial condition. 

21. There is no monitoring agency appointed by our Company and the deployment of funds are at the 

discretion of our Management and our Board of Directors, though it shall be monitored by the 

Audit Committee. 

As per SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, 2009 appointment of monitoring agency is required only for Issue 

size above Rs. 50,000 Lakhs. Hence, we have not appointed a monitoring agency to monitor the 

utilization of Issue proceeds. However, the audit committee of our Board will monitor the utilization 

of Issue proceeds. Further, our Company shall inform about material deviations in the utilization of 

Issue proceeds to the BSE Limited and shall also simultaneously make the material deviations / 

adverse comments of the audit committee public. 

22. Failure to manage our inventory could have an adverse effect on our net sales, profitability, cash 

flow and liquidity. 

The results of operations of our business are dependent on our ability to effectively manage our 

inventory and stocks. To effectively manage our inventory, we must be able to accurately estimate 

customer demand and supply requirements and purchase new inventory accordingly. If our 

management has misjudged expected customer demand it could adversely impact the results by 

causing either a shortage of products or an accumulation of excess inventory. Further, if we fail to sell 

the inventory we manufacture or purchase, we may be required to write-down our inventory or pay 

our suppliers without new purchases or create additional vendor financing, which could have an 

adverse impact on our income and cash flows.  

23. We may not be successful in implementing our business strategies. 

The success of our business depends substantially on our ability to implement our business strategies 

effectively. Even though we have successfully executed our business strategies in the past, there is 

no guarantee that we can implement the same on time and within the estimated budget going 

forward, or that we will be able to meet the expectations of our targeted clients. Changes in 



 

Page 24 of 371 

 

regulations applicable to us may also make it difficult to implement our business strategies. Failure 

to implement our business strategies would have a material adverse effect on our business and results 

of operations. 

24. Our clients can suspend or cancel delivery of our products at any time, without cause and with 

little or no notice or payment 

Our Company has not entered into any written agreement with clients. Hence, the clients can 

terminate the delivery at any stage. Further, events of force majeure, such as disruptions of 

transportation services because of weather-related problems, strikes, lock-outs, inadequacies in road 

infrastructure, government actions or other events that are beyond the control of the parties, which 

allow our suppliers to suspend or cancel their deliveries of bought out items could impair our ability 

to source our products and our ability to supply. Similarly, our clients may suspend or cancel 

delivery of our products during a period of force majeure. The suspension, termination or 

cancellation of an order by our clients would reduce our revenues and may cause us to experience 

higher than expected number of unassigned employees and under-utilisation of resources previously 

dedicated to those clients, thereby reducing our profit margin. We may not be able to replace any 

client that elects to terminate, which may adversely affect our business and income. 

25. We have high working capital requirements. If we experience insufficient cash flows to meet 

required payments on our working capital requirements, there may be an adverse effect on our 

results of operations. 

Our business requires a substantial amount of working capital. In many cases, working capital is 

required to finance the purchase of materials before payment is received from clients. Our working 

capital requirements may increase if, in certain contracts, payment terms do not provide for advance 

payments to us or if payment schedules are less favourable to us. We may need to borrow additional 

funds in the future to fulfill our working capital needs. Continued increases in working capital 

requirements may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

26. We operate in a highly competitive environment and may not be able to compete, which may 

adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

The industry, in which we are operating, is highly and increasingly competitive and unorganised and 

our results of operations and financial condition are sensitive to, and may be materially adversely 

affected by, competitive pricing and other factors. Competition may result in pricing pressures, 

reduced profit margins or lost market share or a failure to grow our market share, any of which could 

substantially harm our business and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we can 

effectively compete with our competitors in the future, and any such failure to compete effectively 

may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

27. Our success depends largely upon the services of our Promoter Directors and other Key 

Managerial Personnel and our ability to attract and retain them. Demand for Key Managerial 

Personnel in the industry is intense and our inability to attract and retain Key Managerial 

Personnel may affect the operations of our Company 

Our Directors and key managerial personnel have built relations with clients and other persons who 

are connected with our business. Our success is substantially dependent on the expertise and services 

of our Directors and our Key Managerial Personnel. They provide expertise which enables us to make 

well informed decisions in relation to our business and our future prospects. Our future performance 

will depend upon the continued services of these persons. We cannot assure you that we will be able 

to retain any or all, or that our succession planning will help to replace, the key members of our 

management. The loss of the services of such key members of our management team and the failure 

of any succession plans to replace such key members could have an adverse effect on our business 

and the results of our operations. 



 

Page 25 of 371 
 

28. We have applied for registration of our Logo / Trademark but do not own the same as on the date 

of this Draft Prospectus 

We have made an application for registration of our Logo/trademark  on March 10, 2016 

under the Trademarks Act, 1999 and is in the process of getting the same registered. If our Company 

is unable to obtain registration of trademark, it may not be able to successfully enforce or protect our 

intellectual property rights and obtain statutory protections available under the Trademarks Act, 1999, 

as otherwise available for registered trademarks. This could have a material adverse effect on our 

business, which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations. 

29. In addition to normal remuneration or benefits and reimbursement of expenses, some of our 

Directors and key managerial personnel are interested in our Company to the extent of their 

shareholding and dividend entitlement in our Company 

Our Directors and Key Managerial Personnel are interested in our Company to the extent of 

remuneration paid to them for services rendered and reimbursement of expenses payable to them. In 

addition, some of our Directors and Key Managerial Personnel may also be interested to the extent of 

their shareholding and dividend entitlement in our Company. For further information, see ―Capital 

Structure‖ and ―Our Management‖ on pages 63 and 165, respectively, of this Draft Prospectus. 

30. Our insurance policies do not cover all risks, specifically risks like product defect/liability risk, loss 

of profits and terrorism. In the event of the occurrence of such events, our insurance coverage may 

not adequately protect us against possible risk of loss. 

Our Company has obtained insurance coverage in respect of certain risks. Our significant insurance 

policies consist of, among others, standard fire and special perils. While we believe that we maintain 

insurance coverage in adequate amounts consistent with size of our business, our insurance policies 

do not cover all risks, specifically risks like product defect/liability risk, loss of profits, losses due to 

terrorism, etc. There can be no assurance that our insurance policies will be adequate to cover the 

losses in respect of which the insurance has been availed. If we suffer a significant uninsured loss or 

if insurance claim in respect of the subject-matter of insurance is not accepted or any insured loss 

suffered by us significantly exceeds our insurance coverage, our business, financial condition and 

results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 

31. Negative publicity with respect to our business could adversely affect our business, financial 

condition and results of operations 

Our business is dependent on the trust of our clients have in the quality of our imported Chemicals. 

Any negative publicity regarding us, our products could adversely affect our reputation and our 

results of our operations. 

32. We have issued Equity Shares in the last twelve months, the price of which may be lower than the 

Issue Price. 

Our Company has issued 11,72,500 Equity shares through Private Placement and 4,22,970 Bonus 

Equity Shares and in the last twelve months which were issued at price lower then the Issue price. 

For further details of Equity Shares issued, please refer to chapter titled, ‘Capital Structure‘ 

beginning on page 63 of this Prospectus. 

33. We have entered into certain related party transactions and may continue to do so. 

We have entered into related party transactions with our Promoters and Directors. While we believe 

that all such transactions have been conducted on the arms length basis, however it is difficult to 

ascertain whether more favorable terms would have been achieved had such transactions been 

entered with unrelated parties. Furthermore, it is likely that we will enter into related party 



 

Page 26 of 371 

 

transactions in the future. For details of these transactions, please refer to section titled ―Related 

Party Transactions‖ at page 185 of this draft Prospectus. 

34. Within the parameters as mentioned in the chapter titled „Objects of the Issue‟ beginning on page 

101 of this Draft Prospectus, our Company‟s management will have flexibility in applying the 

proceeds of this Issue. The fund requirement and deployment mentioned in the Objects of this 

Issue have not been appraised by any bank or financial institution 

We intend to use entire Issue Proceeds for marketing activities, working capital, general corporate 

purpose and issue expenses. We intend to deploy the Net Issue Proceeds in Financial Year 2014-

2015, 2015-2016 and such deployment is based on certain assumptions and strategy which our 

Company believes to implement in future. The funds raised from the Issue may remain idle on 

account of change in assumptions, market conditions, strategy of our Company, etc. For further 

details on the use of the Issue Proceeds, please refer chapter titled "Objects of the Issue" beginning on 

page 101 of this draft Prospectus. 

The deployment of funds for the purposes described above is at the discretion of our Company‘s 

Board of Directors and is not subject to monitoring by any independent monitoring agency. The fund 

requirement and deployment is based on internal management estimates and has not been appraised 

by any bank or financial institution. Accordingly, within the parameters as mentioned in the chapter 

titled ‗Objects of the Issue‘ beginning on page 101 of this draft Prospectus, the Management will have 

significant flexibility in applying the proceeds received by our Company from the Issue. However, 

Audit Committee will monitor the utilization of the proceeds of this Issue and prepare the statement 

for utilization of the proceeds of this Issue. 

35. Our ability to pay dividends will depend upon future earnings, financial condition, cash flows, 

working capital requirements, capital expenditures and other factors 

The amount of our future dividend payments, if any, will depend upon various factors such as our 

future earnings, financial condition, cash flows, working capital requirements, capital expenditures 

and other factors. There can be no assurance that we shall have distributable funds or that we will 

declare dividends in the future. Additionally, the terms of any financing which we may seek in future, 

may contain restrictive covenants which may also affect some of the rights of our shareholders, 

including the payment of the dividend. 

36. Our Promoter and Directors may have interest in our Company, other than reimbursement of 

expenses incurred or remuneration 

Our Promoter and Directors may be deemed to be interested to the extent of the Equity Shares held 

and rent received by them or their relatives and benefits deriving from their directorship in our 

Company. For further details, please refer to the chapters titled ―Our Business‖, ―Our Promoters and 

Promoter Group‖ and ―Related Party Transactions‖ beginning on page 146, 179 and 185 respectively 

of this Draft Prospectus. 

37. Our future funds requirements, in the form of fresh issue of capital or securities and/or loans 

taken by us, may be prejudicial to the interest of the shareholders depending upon the terms on 

which they are eventually raised. 

We may require additional capital from time to time depending on our business needs. Any fresh 

issue of shares or convertible securities would dilute the shareholding of the existing shareholders 

and such issuance may be done on terms and conditions, which may not be favourable to the then 

existing shareholders. If such funds are raised in the form of loans or debt, then it may substantially 

increase our interest burden and decrease our cash flows, thus prejudicially affecting our profitability 

and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders. 



 

Page 27 of 371 
 

38. Our Promoters and members of the Promoter Group will continue jointly to retain majority control 

over our Company after the Issue, which will allow them to determine the outcome of matters 

submitted to shareholders for approval. 

After completion of the Issue, our Promoters and Promoter Group will collectively own 62.15 % of 

the Equity Shares. As a result, our Promoters together with the members of the Promoter Group will 

be able to exercise a significant degree of influence over us and will be able to control the outcome of 

any proposal that can be approved by a majority shareholder vote, including, the election of members 

to our Board, in accordance with the Companies Act and our Articles of Association. Such a 

concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in 

control of our Company. 

In addition, our Promoters will continue to have the ability to cause us to take actions that are not in, 

or may conflict with, our interests or the interests of some or all of our creditors or minority 

shareholders, and we cannot assure you that such actions will not have an adverse effect on our future 

financial performance or the price of our Equity Shares. 

39. Our Company is dependent on third party transportation providers for the delivery of bought out 

items and any disruption in their operations or decrease in the quality of their services could affect 

our Company's reputation and results of operations 

Our Company uses third party transportation providers for delivery of our products. Though our 

business has not experienced any disruptions due to transportation strikes in the past, any future 

transportation strikes may have an adverse effect on our business. These transportation facilities may 

not be adequate to support our existing and future operations. In addition products may be lost or 

damaged in transit for various reasons including occurrence of accidents or natural disasters. There 

may also be delay in receipt of products which may also affect our business and results of operation 

negatively. An increase in the freight costs or unavailability of freight for transportation of our 

products may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 

Further, disruptions of transportation services due to weather-related problems, strikes, lock-outs, 

inadequacies in the road infrastructure and port facilities, or other events could impair ability to 

procure products on time. Any such disruptions could materially and adversely affect our business, 

financial condition and results of operations. 

40. We could be harmed by employee misconduct or errors that are difficult to detect and any such 

incidences could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and reputation 

Employee misconduct or errors could expose us to business risks or losses, including regulatory 

sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. There can be no assurance that we will be able to detect 

or deter such misconduct. Moreover, the precautions we take to prevent and detect such activity may 

not be effective in all cases. Our employees and agents may also commit errors that could subject us 

to claims and proceedings for alleged negligence, as well as regulatory actions on account of which 

our business, financial condition, results of operations and goodwill could be adversely affected. 

41. Our future funds requirements, in the form of fresh issue of capital or securities and/or loans 

taken by us, may be prejudicial to the interest of the shareholders depending upon the terms on 

which they are eventually raised 

We may require additional capital from time to time depending on our business needs. Any fresh 

issue of shares or convertible securities would dilute the shareholding of the existing shareholders and 

such issuance may be done on terms and conditions, which may not be favorable to the then existing 

shareholders. If such funds are raised in the form of loans or debt, then it may substantially increase 

our interest burden and decrease our cash flows, thus prejudicially affecting our profitability and 

ability to pay dividends to our shareholders. 



 

Page 28 of 371 

 

42. Any future equity offerings may lead to dilution of your shareholding in our Company 

Investors in this Issue may experience dilution of their shareholding to the extent that our Company 

makes future equity or convertible offerings. Further, any perception or belief that further issues 

might occur may adversely affect the trading price of our Equity Shares. 

 Issue Specific Risks 

43. There are restrictions on daily/weekly/monthly movements in the price of the Equity Shares, which 

may adversely affect a shareholder‟s ability to sell, or the price at which it can sell, Equity Shares 

at a particular point in time. 

Once listed, we would be subject to circuit breakers imposed by all stock exchanges in India, which 

does not allow transactions beyond specified increases or decreases in the price of the Equity Shares. 

This circuit breaker operates independently of the index-based market-wide circuit breakers generally 

imposed by SEBI on Indian stock exchanges. The percentage limit on circuit breakers is set by the 

stock exchanges based on the historical volatility in the price and trading volume of the Equity 

Shares. The stock exchanges do not inform us of the percentage limit of the circuit breaker in effect 

from time to time, and may change it without our knowledge. This circuit breaker limits the upward 

and downward movements in the price of the Equity Shares. As a result of this circuit breaker, no 

assurance may be given regarding your ability to sell your Equity Shares or the price at which you 

may be able to sell your Equity Shares at any particular time. 

44. After this Issue, the price of the Equity Shares may be highly volatile, or an active trading market 

for the Equity Shares may not develop. 

The price of the Equity Shares on the Stock Exchanges may fluctuate as a result of the factors, 

including: 

a. Volatility in the Indian and global capital market; 

b. Company‘s results of operations and financial performance; 

c. Performance of Company‘s competitors; 

d. Adverse media reports on Company or pertaining to the hospitality Industry; 

e. Changes in our estimates of performance or recommendations by financial analysts; 

f. Significant developments in India‘s economic and fiscal policies; and 

g. Significant developments in India‘s environmental regulations. 

Current valuations may not be sustainable in the future and may also not be reflective of future 

valuations for our industry and our Company. There has been no public market for the Equity Shares 

and the prices of the Equity Shares may fluctuate after this Issue. There can be no assurance that an 

active trading market for the Equity Shares will develop or be sustained after this Issue or that the 

price at which the Equity Shares are initially traded will correspond to the price at which the Equity 

Shares will trade in the market subsequent to this Issue. 

45. The Issue price of our Equity Shares may not be indicative of the market price of our Equity 

Shares after the Issue and the market price of our Equity Shares may decline below the issue price 

and you may not be able to sell your Equity Shares at or above the Issue Price. 

The Issue Price of our Equity Shares has been determined by fixed price method. This price is be 

based on numerous factors (For further information, please refer chapter titled ―Basis for Issue Price‖ 

beginning on page 107 of this Draft Prospectus and may not be indicative of the market price of our 

Equity Shares after the Issue. The market price of our Equity Shares could be subject to significant 

fluctuations after the Issue, and may decline below the Issue Price. We cannot assure you that you 

will be able to sell your Equity Shares at or above the Issue Price. Among the factors that could affect 

our share price include without limitation. The following: 



 

Page 29 of 371 
 

 Half yearly variations in the rate of growth of our financial indicators, such as earnings per 

share, net income and revenues; 

 Changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports by analysts; 

 Speculation in the press or investment community; 

 General market conditions; and 

 Domestic and international economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our 

performance. 

46. You will not be able to sell immediately on Stock Exchange any of the Equity Shares you purchase 

in the Issue until the Issue receives appropriate trading permissions. 

The Equity Shares will be listed on the Stock Exchange. Pursuant to Indian regulations, certain 

actions must be completed before the Equity Shares can be listed and trading may commence. We 

cannot assure you that the Equity Shares will be credited to investor‘s demat accounts, or that trading 

in the Equity Shares will commence, within the time periods specified in the Draft Prospectus. Any 

failure or delay in obtaining the approval would restrict your ability to dispose of the Equity Shares. 

In accordance with section 40 of the Companies Act, 2013, in the event that the permission of listing 

the Equity Shares is denied by the stock exchanges, we are required to refund all monies collected to 

investors. 

47. Sale of Equity Shares by our Promoter or other significant shareholder(s) may adversely affect the 

trading price of the Equity Shares. 

Any instance of disinvestments of equity shares by our Promoter or by other significant 

shareholder(s) may significantly affect the trading price of our Equity Shares. Further, our market 

price may also be adversely affected even if there is a perception or belief that such sales of Equity 

Shares might occur. 

EXTERNAL RISK FACTORS 

Industry Risks:  

48. Changes in government regulations or their implementation could disrupt our operations and 

adversely affect our business and results of operations. 

Our business and industry is regulated by different laws, rules and regulations framed by the Central 

and State Government. These regulations can be amended/ changed on a short notice at the discretion 

of the Government. If we fail to comply with all applicable regulations or if the regulations governing 

our business or their implementation change adversely, we may incur increased costs or be subject to 

penalties, which could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and results of 

operations. 

Other Risks 

49. The Companies Act, 2013 has effected significant changes to the existing Indian company law 

framework, which may subject us to higher compliance requirements and increase our compliance 

costs. 

A majority of the provisions and rules under the Companies Act, 2013 have recently been notified 

and have come into effect from the date of their respective notification, resulting in the corresponding 

provisions of the Companies Act, 1956 ceasing to have effect. The Companies Act, 2013 has brought 

into effect significant changes to the Indian company law framework, such as in the provisions related 

to issue of capital, disclosures in draft prospectus / prospectus, corporate governance norms, audit 

matters, related party transactions, introduction of a provision allowing the initiation of class action 

suits in India against companies by shareholders or depositors, a restriction on investment by an 

Indian company through more than two layers of subsidiary investment companies (subject to certain 



 

Page 30 of 371 

 

permitted exceptions), prohibitions on loans to directors and insider trading and restrictions on 

directors and key managerial personnel from engaging in forward dealing. To ensure compliance with 

the requirements of the Companies Act, 2013, we may need to allocate additional resources, which 

may increase our regulatory compliance costs and divert management attention. 

The Companies Act, 2013 introduced certain additional requirements which do not have 

corresponding equivalents under the Companies Act, 1956. Accordingly, we may face challenges in 

interpreting and complying with such provisions due to limited jurisprudence on them. In the event, 

our interpretation of such provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 differs from, or contradicts with, 

any judicial pronouncements or clarifications issued by the Government in the future, we may face 

regulatory actions or we may be required to undertake remedial steps. We may face difficulties in 

complying with any such overlapping requirements. Further, we cannot currently determine the 

impact of provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 which are yet to come in force. Any increase in our 

compliance requirements or in our compliance costs may have an adverse effect on our business and 

results of operations. 

50. You may be subject to Indian taxes arising out of capital gains on the sale of the Equity Shares.  

Under current Indian tax laws and regulations, capital gains arising from the sale of equity shares in 

an Indian company are generally taxable in India. Any gain realised on the sale of shares on a stock 

exchange held for more than 12 months will not be subject to capital gains tax in India if the 

securities transaction tax (―STT‖) has been paid on the transaction. The STT will be levied on and 

collected by an Indian stock exchange on which equity shares are sold. Any gain realised on the sale 

of shares held for more than 12 months to an Indian resident, which are sold other than on a 

recognised stock exchange and as a result of which no STT has been paid, will be subject to long term 

capital gains tax in India. Further, any gain realised on the sale of shares held for a period of 12 

months or less will be subject to capital gains tax in India. Further, any gain realised on the sale of 

listed equity shares held for a period of 12 months or less which are sold other than on a recognised 

stock exchange and on which no STT has been paid, will be subject to short term capital gains tax at a 

relatively higher rate as compared to the transaction where STT has been paid in India. 

51. Significant differences exist between Indian GAAP and other accounting principles, such as U.S. 

GAAP and IFRS, which may be material to the financial statements prepared and presented in 

accordance with SEBI ICDR Regulations contained in this Draft Prospectus. 

As stated in the reports of the Auditor included in this Draft Prospectus under chapter ―Financial 

Statements as restated‖ beginning on page 187, the financial statements included in this Draft 

Prospectus are based on financial information that is based on the audited financial statements that are 

prepared and presented in conformity with Indian GAAP and restated in accordance with the SEBI 

ICDR Regulations, and no attempt has been made to reconcile any of the information given in this 

Draft Prospectus to any other principles or to base it on any other standards. Indian GAAP differs 

from accounting principles and auditing standards with which prospective investors may be familiar 

in other countries, such as U.S. GAAP and IFRS. Significant differences exist between Indian GAAP 

and U.S. GAAP and IFRS, which may be material to the financial information prepared and presented 

in accordance with Indian GAAP contained in this Draft Prospectus. Accordingly, the degree to 

which the financial information included in this Draft Prospectus will provide meaningful information 

is dependent on familiarity with Indian GAAP, the Companies Act and the SEBI ICDR Regulations. 

Any reliance by persons not familiar with Indian GAAP on the financial disclosures presented in this 

Draft Prospectus should accordingly be limited. 

52. Taxes and other levies imposed by the Government of India or other State Governments, as well as 

other financial policies and regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our business, 

financial condition and results of operations. 



 

Page 31 of 371 
 

Taxes and other levies imposed by the Central or State Governments in India that affect our industry 

include: 

 custom duties on imports of raw materials and components; 

 excise duty on certain raw materials and components; 

 central and state sales tax, value added tax and other levies; and 

 other new or special taxes and surcharges introduced on a permanent or temporary basis from 

time to time. 

These taxes and levies affect the cost and prices of our products and therefore demand for our 

product. An increase in any of these taxes or levies, or the imposition of new taxes or levies in the 

future, may have a material adverse effect on our business, profitability and financial condition. 

53. The nationalized goods and services tax (GST) regimes proposed by the Government of India may 

have material impact on our operations. 

The Government of India has proposed a comprehensive national goods and service tax (GST) regime 

that will combine taxes and levies by the Central and State Governments into a unified rate structure. 

Given the limited liability of information in the public domain covering the GST we are unable to 

provide/ measure the impact this tax regime may have on our operations. 

54. Political instability or a change in economic liberalization and deregulation policies could 

seriously harm business and economic conditions in India generally and our business in 

particular.  

The Government of India has traditionally exercised and continues to exercise influence over many 

aspects of the economy. Our business and the market price and liquidity of our Equity Shares may be 

affected by interest rates, changes in Government policy, taxation, social and civil unrest and other 

political, economic or other developments in or affecting India. The rate of economic liberalization 

could change, and specific laws and policies affecting the information technology sector, foreign 

investment and other matters affecting investment in our securities could change as well. Any 

significant change in such liberalization and deregulation policies could adversely affect business and 

economic conditions in India, generally, and our business, prospects, financial condition and results 

of operations, in particular. 

55. We cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness of facts and other statistics with respect to 

India, the Indian economy and hospitality industry contained in the Draft Prospectus. 

While facts and other statistics in the Draft Prospectus relating to India, the Indian economy and the 

hospitality industry has been based on various government publications and reports from government 

agencies, reports from research organisation and others that we believe are reliable, we cannot 

guarantee the quality or reliability of such materials. While we have taken reasonable care in the 

reproduction of such information, industry facts and other statistics have not been prepared or 

independently verified by us or any of our respective affiliates or advisors and, therefore we make no 

representation as to their accuracy or completeness. These facts and other statistics include the facts 

and statistics included in the chapter titled ‗Our Industry‘ beginning on page 120 of this Draft 

Prospectus. Due to possibly flawed or ineffective data collection methods or discrepancies between 

published information and market practice and other problems, the statistics herein may be inaccurate 

or may not be comparable to statistics produced elsewhere and should not be unduly relied upon. 

Further, there is no assurance that they are stated or compiled on the same basis or with the same 

degree of accuracy, as the case may be, elsewhere. 

56. Conditions in the Indian securities market may affect the price or liquidity of our Equity Shares. 

The Indian securities markets are smaller than securities markets in more developed economies and 

the regulation and monitoring of Indian securities markets and the activities of investors, brokers and 



 

Page 32 of 371 

 

other participants differ, in some cases significantly, from those in the more developed economies. 

Indian stock exchanges have in the past experienced substantial fluctuations in the prices of listed 

securities. Further, the Indian stock exchanges have also experienced volatility in the recent times. 

57. Global economic, political and social conditions may harm our ability to do business, increase our 

costs and negatively affect our stock price. 

Global economic and political factors that are beyond our control, influence forecasts and directly 

affect performance. These factors include interest rates, rates of economic growth, fiscal and 

monetary policies of governments, inflation, deflation, foreign exchange fluctuations, consumer credit 

availability, fluctuations in commodities markets, consumer debt levels, unemployment trends and 

other matters that influence consumer confidence, spending and tourism. Increasing volatility in 

financial markets may cause these factors to change with a greater degree of frequency and 

magnitude, which may negatively affect our stock prices. 

58. Foreign investors are subject to foreign investment restrictions under Indian law that limits our 

ability to attract foreign investors, which may adversely impact the market price of the Equity 

Shares. 

Under the foreign exchange regulations currently in force in India, transfers of shares between non-

residents and residents are freely permitted (subject to certain exceptions) if they comply with the 

pricing guidelines and reporting requirements specified by the RBI. If the transfer of shares, which 

are sought to be transferred, is not in compliance with such pricing guidelines or reporting 

requirements or fall under any of the exceptions referred to above, then the prior approval of the RBI 

will be required. Additionally, shareholders who seek to convert the Rupee proceeds from a sale of 

shares in India into foreign currency and repatriate that foreign currency from India will require a no 

objection/ tax clearance certificate from the income tax authority. There can be no assurance that any 

approval required from the RBI or any other government agency can be obtained on any particular 

terms or at all. 

59. The extent and reliability of Indian infrastructure could adversely affect our Company's results of 

operations and financial condition. 

India's physical infrastructure is in developing phase compared to that of many developed nations. 

Any congestion or disruption in its port, rail and road networks, electricity grid, communication 

systems or any other public facility could disrupt our Company's normal business activity. Any 

deterioration of India's physical infrastructure would harm the national economy, disrupt the 

transportation of goods and supplies, and add costs to doing business in India. These problems could 

interrupt our Company's business operations, which could have an adverse effect on its results of 

operations and financial condition. 

60. Any downgrading of India‟s sovereign rating by an independent agency may harm our ability to 

raise financing. 

Any adverse revisions to India's credit ratings for domestic and international debt by international 

rating agencies may adversely impact our ability to raise additional financing, and the interest rates 

and other commercial terms at which such additional financing may be available. This could have an 

adverse effect on our business and future financial performance, our ability to obtain financing for 

capital expenditures and the trading price of our Equity Shares. 

61. Natural calamities could have a negative impact on the Indian economy and cause our Company's 

business to suffer. 

India has experienced natural calamities such as earthquakes, tsunami, floods etc. in recent years. The 

extent and severity of these natural disasters determine their impact on the Indian economy. 

Prolonged spells of abnormal rainfall or other natural calamities could have a negative impact on the 



 

Page 33 of 371 
 

Indian economy, which could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results 

of operations as well as the price of the Equity Shares.

BACKGROUND OF CHEMICAL INDUSTRY 

The chemical industry in India is a key constituent of Indian economy, accounting for about 2.11 per cent 

of the gross domestic product (GDP). In terms of volume of production, Indian chemical industry is the 

third largest producer in Asia and sixth largest in the world.  

Indian chemical industry generated business worth US$ 118 billion in 2014. Bulk chemicals account for 

39 per cent of the Indian chemical industry, followed by agrochemicals (20.3 per cent) and specialty 

chemicals (19.5 per cent). Pharmaceuticals and biotechnology accounted for the remaining share. India‘s 

growing per capita consumption and demand for agriculture-related chemicals offers huge scope of 

growth for the sector in the future. Lured by the size and returns of the Indian market, foreign firms have 

strengthened their presence in India. From April 2000 to May 2015, total foreign direct investment (FDI) 

inflows into the Indian chemicals industry (excluding fertilisers) were US$ 10.49 billion. 

The Government of India has been supportive to the sector. 100 per cent FDI is permissible in the Indian 

chemicals sector while manufacturing of most chemical products is de-licensed. The government has also 

been encouraging Research and Development (R&D) in the sector. Moreover, the government is 

continuously reducing the list of reserved chemical items for production in the small-scale sector, thereby 

facilitating greater investment in technology up-gradation and modernisation. 

The Government has launched the Draft National Chemical Policy, which aims to increase chemical 

sector‘s share in country‘s GDP.

GLOBAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT 

GLOBAL ECONOMIC OVERVIEW 

The global macroeconomic landscape is currently chartering a rough and uncertain terrain characterized 

by weak growth of world output. The situation has been exacerbated by; (i) declining prices of a number 

of commodities, with reduction in crude oil prices being the most visible of them, (ii) turbulent financial 

markets (more so equity markets), and (iii) volatile exchange rates. These conditions reflect extreme risk-

aversion behaviour of global investors, thus putting many, and in particular, commodities exporting 

economies under considerable stress. 

One important positive outcome in 2015 is the modest pickup in the growth of some of the advanced 

economies. However, growth in emerging market and developing economies declined for the fifth 

consecutive year. As a result, overall global economic activity remained subdued in 2015. In its latest 

Update of the World Economic Outlook (WEO), published on 19 January 2016, the IMF projected 

growth in the global economy to improve from 3.1 per cent in 2015, to 3.4 per cent in 2016 and further to 

http://www.ibef.org/


 

Page 36 of 371 

 

3.6 per cent in 2017. Growth in advanced economies is projected at 2.1 per cent in 2016 and to continue 

through 2017 at the same rate. 

The slowdown and rebalancing of the Chinese economy, lower commodity prices, and strains in some 

large Emerging Market and Developing economies (EMDE) are likely to continue to weigh on their 

growth prospects in 2016–17. Assessments indicate that mixed inflation developments in the EMDEs 

reflect the conflicting implications of weak domestic demand and lower commodity prices versus marked 

currency depreciations over the past year. The WEO update also indicated that India and the rest of 

emerging Asia are bright spots, with some other countries facing strong headwinds from China‘s 

economic rebalancing and global manufacturing weakness. World trade volume growth projections have 

been placed at 2.6 per cent and 3.4 per cent respectively for 2015 and 2016, which is much lower than 

what was estimated earlier in WEO in October 2015.

REVIEW OF MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS IN INDIAN ECONOMY 

In the Advance Estimates of GDP that the Central Statistics Office (CSO) released recently, the growth 

rate of GDP at constant market prices is projected to increase to 7.6 per cent in 2015-16 from 7.2 per cent 

in 2014-15, mainly because private final consumption expenditure has accelerated. Similarly, the growth 

rate of GVA for 2015-16 is estimated at 7.3 per cent vis-à-vis 7.1 per cent in 2014-15. Although 

agriculture is likely to register low growth for the second year in a row on account of weak monsoons, it 

has performed better than last year. Industry has shown significant improvement primarily on account of 

the surprising acceleration in manufacturing (9.5 per cent vis-à-vis 5.5 per cent in 2014-15). Meanwhile, 

services continue to expand rapidly. 

 Even as real growth has been accelerating, nominal growth has been falling, to historically low 

levels, an unusual trend highlighted in the Mid-Year Economic Analysis (MYEA), 2015-16. 

 According to the Advance Estimates, nominal GDP (GVA) is likely to increase by just 8.6 (6.8) 

percent in 2015-16.  

 In nominal terms, construction is expected to stagnate, while even the dynamic sectors of trade 

and finance are projected to grow by only 7 to 73/4 percent. 

 Inflation remains under control The CPI-New Series inflation has fluctuated around 51/2 percent, 

while measures of underlying trends—core inflation, rural wage growth and minimum support 

price increases—have similarly remained muted. Meanwhile, the WPI has been in negative 

territory since November 2014, the result of the large falls in international commodity prices, 

especially oil. As low inflation has taken hold and confidence in price stability has improved, 

gold imports have largely stabilized, notwithstanding the end of a period of import controls 

 Similarly, the external position appears robust. The current account deficit has declined and is at 

comfortable levels; foreign exchange reserves have risen to US$351.5 billion in early February 

2016, and are well above standard norms for reserve adequacy; net FDI inflows have grown from 

US$21.9 billion in April-December 2014-15 to US$27.7 billion in the same period of 2015-16; 

and the nominal value of the rupee, measured against a basket of currencies, has been steady. 

India was consequently well-positioned to absorb the volatility from the U.S. Federal Reserve 

actions to normalize monetary policy that occurred in December 2015. Although the rupee has 

declined against the dollar, it has strengthened against the currencies of its other trading partners. 

 The fiscal sector registered three striking successes: on-going fiscal consolidation, improved 

indirect tax collection efficiency; and an improvement in the quality of spending at all levels of 

government. 

http://www.indiabudget.nic.in/


 

Page 37 of 371 
 

 Government tax revenues are expected to be higher than budgeted levels. Direct taxes grew by 

10.7 per cent in the first 9 months (9M) of 2015-16. Indirect taxes were also buoyant. In part, this 

reflected excise taxes on diesel and petrol and an increase in the Swachh Bharat cess. The central 

excise duty collection from petroleum products during April to December 2015-16 recorded a 

growth of 90.5 per cent and stood at Rs.1.3 lakh crore as against Rs. 0.7 lakh crore in the same 

period last year. Tax performance also reflected an improvement in tax administration because 

revenues increased even after stripping out the additional revenue measures (ARMs). Indirect tax 

revenues grew by 10.7 per cent (without ARMs) and 34.2 per cent (with ARMs). 

 The main findings are that a welcome shift in the quality of spending has occurred from revenue 

to investment, and towards social sectors. Aggregate public investment has increased by about 0.6 

per cent of GDP in the first 8 months of this fiscal year, with contributions from both the Centre 

(54 per cent) and states (46 per cent).

OUTLOOK FOR GROWTH 

Real GDP growth for 2015-16 is expected to be in the 7 to 73/4range, reflecting various and largely 

offsetting developments on the demand and supply sides of the Indian economy. Before analysing these 

factors, however, it is important to step back and note one important point. India‘s long-run potential 

GDP growth is substantial, about 8-10 percent. But its actual growth in the short run will also depend 

upon global growth and demand. After all, India‘s exports of manufactured goods and services now 

constitute about 18 percent of GDP, up from about 11 percent a decade ago. 

Reflecting India‘s growing globalization, the correlation between India‘s growth rate and that of the 

world has risen sharply to reasonably high levels. For the period 1991-2002 this correlation was 0.2. 

Since then, the correlation has doubled to 0.42. In other words, a 1 percentage point decrease in the world 

growth rate is now associated with a 0.42 percentage point decrease in Indian growth rates. 

Accordingly, if the world economy remains weak, India‘s growth will face considerable headwinds. For 

example, if the world continues to grow at close to 3 percent over the next few years rather than returning 

to the buoyant 4-4½ per cent recorded during 2003-2011, India‘s medium-term growth trajectory could 

well remain closer to 7-7½ per cent, notwithstanding the government‘s reform initiatives, rather than rise 

to the 8-10 per cent that its long-run potential suggests. In other words, in the current global environment, 

there needs to be a recalibration of growth expectations and consequently of the standards of assessment. 

Turning to the outlook for 2016-17, we need to examine each of the components of aggregate demand: 

exports, consumption, private investment and government. 

 To measure the demand for India‘s exports, we calculate a proxy-weighted average GDP growth 

rate of India‘s export partners. The weights are the shares of partner countries in India‘s exports 

of goods and services. We find that this proxy for export demand growth declined from 3.0 

percent in 2014 to 2.7 per cent in 2015, which helps explain the deceleration in India‘s non-oil 

exports, although the severity of the slowdown—in fact, a decline in export volume—went 

beyond adverse external developments. Current projections by the IMF indicate that trading 

partner growth this demand will improve marginally this year to about 2.8 percent. But the 

considerable downside risks suggest that it would be prudent not to count on a big contribution to 

GDP growth from improving export performance. 

 On the domestic side, two factors could boost consumption. If and to the extent that the Seventh 

Pay Commission (7th PC) is implemented, increased spending from higher wages and allowances 

of government workers will start flowing through the economy. If, in addition, the monsoon 

returns to normal, agricultural incomes will improve, with attendant gains for rural consumption, 

which over the past two years of weak rains has remained depressed. 

http://www.indiabudget.nic.in/


 

Page 38 of 371 

 

 Against this, the disappearance of much of last year‘s oil windfall would work to reduce 

consumption growth. Current prospects suggest that oil prices (Indian crude basket) might 

average US$ 35 per barrel next fiscal year compared with US$ 45 per barrel in 2015-16. The 

resulting income gain would amount roughly equivalent to 1 percentage point of GDP – an 18 per 

cent price decline times a share of net oil imports in GDP of 6 percent. But this would be half the 

size of last year‘s gain, so consumption growth would slow on this account next year. 

 According to analysis done by Credit Suisse, (non-financial) corporate sector profitability has 

remained weak, falling by 1 percent in the year to December 2015.This decline reflected a sharp 

deterioration in the financial health of the metals—primarily steel—companies, which have now 

joined the ranks of companies under severe financial stress. As a result, the proportion of 

corporate debt owed by stressed companies, defined as those whose earnings are insufficient to 

cover their interest obligations, has increased to 41 percent in December 2015, compared to 35 

percent in December 2014.3 In response to this stress, companies have once again been 

compelled to curb their capital expenditures substantially. 

 Finally, the path for fiscal consolidation will determine the demand for domestic output from 

government. The magnitude of the drag on demand and output will be largely equal to the size of 

consolidation, assuming a multiplier of about 1. 

 There are three significant downside risks. Turmoil in the global economy could worsen the 

outlook for exports and tighter financial conditions significantly. Second, if contrary to 

expectations oil prices rise more than anticipated, this would increase the drag from consumption, 

both directly, and owing to reduced prospects for monetary easing. Finally, the most serious risk 

is a combination of the above two factors. This could arise if oil markets are dominated by 

supply-related factors such as agreements to restrict output by the major producers. 

 The one significant upside possibility is a good monsoon. This would increase rural consumption 

and, to the extent that it dampens price pressures, open up further space for monetary easing. 

 Putting these factors together, we expect real GDP growth to be in the 7 to 7 3/4 per cent range, 

with downside risks because of on-going developments in the world economy. The wider range in 

the forecast this time reflects the range of possibilities for exogenous developments, from a 

rebound in agriculture to a full-fledged international crisis; it also reflects uncertainty arising 

from the divergence between growth in nominal and real aggregates of economic activity.

INDIA‟S INCREASING IMPORTANCE TO GLOBAL GROWTH  

Despite global headwinds and a truant monsoon, India registered robust growth of 7.2 per cent in 2014-15 

and 7.6 per cent in 2015-16, thus becoming the fastest growing major economy in the world. As per the 

estimates of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), global growth averaged 3.1 per cent in 2015, 

declining from 3.4 per cent registered in 2014. While growth in advanced economies has improved 

modestly since 2013, the emerging economies have witnessed a consistently declining trend in growth 

rate since 2010. It is against this background that the recent Indian growth story appears particularly 

bright. 

India has made striking progress in its contribution to the global growth of Gross Domestic Product 

(GDP) in Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) terms. PPP represents the number of units of a country's 

currency required to purchase the same amount of goods and services in the domestic market as the US 

dollar would purchase in the United States, thus adjusting for purchasing power differentials between 

currencies in relevant markets. India‘s contribution to global growth in PPP terms increased from an 

average of 8.3 per cent during the period 2001 to 2007 to 14.4 per cent in 2014. During the 1990s, the 

US‘s contribution to the global GDP growth in PPP terms was, on an average, around 16 percentage 

http://www.indiabudget.nic.in/


 

Page 39 of 371 
 

points higher than India‘s. The picture changed dramatically in 2013 and 2014 when India‘s contribution 

was higher than that of the US by 2.2 and 2.7 percentage points respectively. During 1991-2014, low 

growth in Japan (0.9 per cent annually) resulted in its low contribution (1.5 per cent) to global growth. 

India and China constitute 42.5 per cent and 53.2 per cent respectively of the total PPP measure of the 

lower-middle income countries and upper-middle income countries; and hence those country groups 

largely reflect India‘s and China‘s patterns. 

The global economy—in particular the global growth powerhouse, China—is rebalancing, leading to an 

increasing role for India. After the onset of the multiple crises in different parts of the world, India‘s 

contribution has become much more valuable to the global economy. 

India‘s share in world GDP has increased from an average of 4.8 per cent during 2001-07 to 6.1 per cent 

during 2008-13 and further to an average of 7.0 per cent during 2014 to 2015 in current PPP terms (IMF). 

India‘s resilience and current levels of reasonably strong growth should, thus, be appreciated in the light 

of its increasing contribution to global growth.

GLOBAL MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY 

World manufacturing growth in the fourth quarter of 2015 

World manufacturing growth slowed down further in the fourth quarter of 2015, with growth rates in both 

industrialized and developing economies decreasing. Weak business investment and sluggish consumer 

demand are among the major causes of the deceleration of global manufacturing output growth.  

Growth in major emerging industrial economies has weakened, continuing the trend of the first quarter of 

2014.China‘s slowdown and the sharp decline in manufacturing output of Latin American economies are 

the primary causes for the country group‘s weaker growth rate. The fall in commodity prices has affected 

some key emerging commodity export-dependent countries, namely Brazil and South Africa, and has 

resulted in currency depreciation. 

 

(Source: World Manufacturing Production- Statistics for Quarter IV, 2015; United Nations Industrial 

Development Organisation - www.unido.org) 

The upturn in manufacturing growth observed in industrialized economies in the third quarter of 2015 did 

not continue in the fourth quarter of 2015, and this country group‘s production output decreased 

significantly. The slowdown in Europe and North America, along with a further decline in East Asian 

economies, resulted in a sharp deceleration in the country group‘s manufacturing output growth. In the

United States, manufacturing exports slowed as a result of the strong US dollar and the low oil prices. 

Continued decline in China has also weakened Chinese demand for imports from Europe. 

Global manufacturing output growth rose by merely 1.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2015, down from 

a 2.6 per cent revised growth estimate in the third quarter. Slow investment growth, lower commodity and 

energy prices, weak global demand and geopolitical tensions are among the main causes of the overall 

flat-lining growth. However, these factors are having different effects on different economies. For 

example, favourable oil prices have reduced the business costs in oil importing countries, especially in 

industrialized economies, while oil exporting economies have been subject to increasing financial 

pressure. 

The manufacturing output of industrialized countries rose by 0.2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2015. 

This slow growth is attributable to a mixture of weaker growth figures in the United States and Europe 

and a decline in East Asia‘s manufacturing output. The question of the robustness of recovery in 

industrialized economies has been raised in earlier quarterly reports. 

The growth of manufacturing output in developing and emerging industrial economies decreased to 4.6 

per cent, down from 5.2 per cent growth in the previous quarter. The growth outlook varies between 

different developing and emerging regions and groups; e.g. manufacturing output grew by 6.1 per cent in 

developing countries in Asia and the Pacific compared to the same period of the previous year, while it 

declined by 4.0 per cent in the Latin America region. Manufacturing output has also declined slightly (0.2 

per cent) in Africa. 

Despite the slower pace of growth, developing and emerging industrial economies were the main drivers 

of global manufacturing growth. Their combined contribution to global manufacturing growth was around 

80 per cent. This indicates the significance of manufacturing activities within the group for the overall 

global picture.

Key Findings on World Manufacturing Sector 

On a year-to-year comparison, world manufacturing production grew in all manufacturing sectors in the 

fourth quarter 2015, with the exception of the manufacture of machinery and equipment and printing and 

publishing. The global decline in the production output of the manufacture of machinery is attributable to 

low energy prices. Higher growth rates have been observed in the manufacture of radio and television and 

of chemicals and chemical products. Growth was positive across all industries in developing and 

emerging industrial economies, except a slight decline in the manufacture of motor vehicles. 

Industrialized countries registered negative growth in eight manufacturing industries. 

Among the consumer goods production industries, output of wearing apparel grew by 2.2 per cent in 

developing and emerging markets and by 0.6 per cent in the industrialized country group. The industry‘s 

output grew by 16.9 per cent in the Czech Republic, by 14.6 per cent in the United Kingdom, by 12.8 per 

cent in Egypt, and by 12.3 per cent in Mexico. However, the manufacturing output of the wearing apparel 

fell sharply in Brazil and Indonesia, by 12.9 per cent and 16.4 per cent, respectively. A significant decline 

was also observed in wearing apparel production in Canada and Estonia. The production of textiles grew 

by 4.1 per cent in developing countries while industrialized countries registered a decline of 0.5 per cent 

in this production. At country level, impressive growth in textiles production was recorded in Argentina, 

Estonia and Hungary whereas it dropped sharply in Brazil and Senegal. The production of food and 

beverages grew at a higher rate (5.2 per cent) in developing countries. As such, output grew by 7.8 per 

cent in China, by 7.3 per cent in Indonesia and by 5.2 per cent in Romania. Output declined by 10.3 per 

cent in Tunisia and by 7.0 per cent in Egypt. The food sector was the only manufacturing industry with a 

positive, albeit poor, growth in Brazil.

The notable growth rate of 10.4 per cent was observed in the manufacture of radio, television and 

communication equipment in developing and emerging countries, with China, Egypt and India being the 

leading manufacturers. In industrialized markets, the highest growth rate in this manufacturing sector was 

seen in France. 

The production of motor vehicles fell marginally by 0.4 per cent in developing countries, attributed 

mainly to the decline in the industry in Latin American economies. The industry‘s output rose by 4.4 per 

cent in industrialized countries, with Italy, Spain and Sweden being the top producers worldwide in the 

fourth quarter of 2015. The manufacturing production of other transport equipment increased at a higher 

rate in developing countries. 

The manufacture of chemicals and chemical products increased considerably in China, Senegal and 

Tunisia, as well as in Ireland, Netherlands and the Russian Federation. The chemical industry was one of 

the few industries in the Russian Federation recording a higher growth rate, with a 6.6 per cent increase 

compared to the previous year. 

The production of basic metals, which includes the production of basic iron, basic steel, basic precious 

and non-ferrous metals, rose by 5.9 per cent in developing countries compared to the same period of the 

previous year, but dropped by 4.8 per cent in industrialized countries in comparison to the previous year. 

Manufacturing output grew in China, Indonesia and Macedonia, while it fell in all Latin American 

economies and in Africa. 

In the United States, as the largest driver of growth in industrialized economies, the manufacture of 

electrical machinery and apparatus and motor vehicles remained strong in the fourth quarter of 2015. 

However, other industries showed either a decline or a decrease in production output. The combination of 

low energy prices and expensive currency contributed to the economic slowdown of the United States. 

Despite its slow economic growth, China‘s manufacturing output in most industries increased compared 

to the same period of the previous year. China recorded its highest growth rates in the manufacture of 

radio and television (10.1 per cent), chemicals and chemical products (9.8 per cent) and the manufacture 

of basic metals (8.9 per cent).

INDIAN MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY 

Introduction 

The Prime Minister of India, Mr Narendra Modi, has launched the ‗Make in India‘ initiative to place India 

on the world map as a manufacturing hub and give global recognition to the Indian economy. 

The Government of India has set an ambitious target of increasing the contribution of manufacturing 

output to 25 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2025, from 16 per cent currently. 

Market Size 

http://www.unido.org/


 

Page 43 of 371 
 

India‘s manufacturing sector could touch US$ 1 trillion by 2025. There is potential for the sector to 

account for 25-30 per cent of the country‘s GDP and create up to 90 million domestic jobs by 2025. 

Business conditions in the Indian manufacturing sector continue to remain positive. 

In November 2015, the seasonally adjusted Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index 

(PMI) stood at 50.3, which indicated expansion for twenty-fifth consecutive month. The services PMI 

was at 50.1 points in November 2015. 

Road Ahead 

The Government of India has an ambitious plan to locally manufacture as many as 181 products. The 

move could help infrastructure sectors such as power, oil and gas, and automobile manufacturing that 

require large capital expenditure and revive the Rs 1,85,000 crore (US$ 28.42 billion) Indian capital 

goods business. 

India is an attractive hub for foreign investments in the manufacturing sector. Several mobile phone, 

luxury and automobile brands, among others, have set up or are looking to establish their manufacturing 

bases in the country. 

With impetus on developing industrial corridors and smart cities, the government aims to ensure holistic 

development of the nation. The corridors would further assist in integrating, monitoring and developing a 

conducive environment for the industrial development and will promote advance practices in 

manufacturing.

INDIAN CHEMICAL INDUSTRY 

Introduction 

Chemical industry is one of the oldest industries in India. The industry, including petrochemicals, and 

alcohol-based chemicals, has grown at a pace outperforming the overall growth of the industry. 

The Indian chemical industry is at the threshold of rapid growth with the Government of India providing 

an atmosphere of support and encouragement. India's vibrant chemical and petrochemical industry plays 

a significant role in the economic development of our country. In terms of volume, the Indian chemical 

industry is the 6th largest in the world and the 3rd largest in Asia, with the size worth $108.4 billion. 

The Chemicals Industry comprises both small and large scale units. The fiscal concessions granted to 

small sector in mid-eighties led to establishment of large number of units in the Small Scale Industry 

(SSI) sector. Currently, the Indian Chemical Industry is in the midst of major restructuring and 

consolidation phase. With the shift in emphasis on product innovation, brand building and 

environmental friendliness, this industry is increasingly moving towards greater customer-orientation. 

Even though India enjoys an abundant supply of basic raw materials, it will have to build upon technical 

services and marketing capabilities to face global competition and increase its share of exports. 

Overview 

The Indian chemical industry has witnessed robust growth in the past decade and has been ranked 6th 

largest in the world and 3rd largest in the Asia according to United Nations Industrial Development 

Organisation (UNIDO). The industry has been forecast to reach USD 200 billion mark by 2020.  

Strong domestic demand, driven by increasing purchasing power parity in the country, is one of the main 

pillars of Indian manufacturing sector, and India is expected to maintain the healthy growth in the years to 

come. India‘s geographic location provides easy access to the world markets; and low cost advantage, 

http://www.ibef.org/

availability of talent pool and skilled manpower make India the destination of choice.  

Indian government is rendering extensive support to give impetus to the Indian chemical industry and has 

set up the task force to consider suggestions for National Chemical Policy to ensure steady growth of the 

country‘s chemical sector.  

India is the 13th largest country in terms of ethylene capacity and proposes enhancing the refining 

capacity to 300 mmtpa in 2017 from the current 190 mmtpa. India is emerging as Asia‘s refining hub and 

become the net exporter of petrochemicals to countries like the Middle East, Korea, Japan and Singapore. 

Indian government has set ambitious plans to set up Petroleum Chemicals & Petrochemicals Investment 

Regions (PCPIR) in Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and Odisha to accelerate country‘s industrial 

growth. 

The Indian government has earmarked substantial funds to achieve healthy growth of country‘s upstream 

and downstream sectors of the chemical industry. During the 11th Five-Year Plan, Indian government 

reserved INR 0.626 trillion for refining and marketing sectors and increase that to INR 1.54 trillion during 

the 12th Five-Year Plan. Chemicals sector has attracted cumulative FDI of USD 192 million* in 2009-10.

MAJOR SEGMENTS OF INDIAN CHEMICAL INDUSTRY  

The chemical industry is an integral constituent of the growing Indian Industry. It includes basic 

chemicals and its products, petrochemicals, fertilizers, paints, varnishes, gases, soaps, perfumes and 

toiletry and pharmaceuticals. It is one of the most diversified of all industrial sectors covering thousands 

of commercial products. This Industry occupies a pivotal position in meeting basic needs and improving 

quality of life. The industry is the main stay of industrial and agricultural development of the country and 

provides building blocks for several downstream industries, paints, soaps, detergents, pharmaceuticals, 

varnish etc. 

Basic Inorganic and Organic Chemical Industry  

Inorganic chemicals: The inorganic chemicals industry had an output of approximately 5.9 million tonnes 

in 2006-07. Of this, alkaline chemicals contributed 5.26 million tonnes, or nearly 90 per cent and basic 

inorganic chemicals contributed 0.6 million tonnes. Among alkaline chemicals, soda ash is the largest 

segment, contributing to 40 per cent of the output caustic soda has a 36 per cent share and liquid chlorine 

has 24 per cent. Basic inorganic chemicals have grown at a CAGR of 10 per cent, from 374,000 tonnes to 

602,000 tonnes. As a result of faster growth, the share of basic inorganic chemicals has gone up, from 8 

per cent to 10 per cent. Carbon black is the biggest segment in basic inorganic chemicals, with a share of 

nearly 71 per cent of the output. Calcium carbide with 16 per cent and titanium dioxide with 10 per cent, 

are the other significant segments.  

Drugs & Pharmaceuticals  

India's drugs and pharmaceuticals industry is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate 

(CAGR) of 14 per cent to reach a turnover of Rs 2.91 trillion (US$ 47.06 billion) by 2018. The domestic 

drugs industry, which is valued at Rs 1.6 trillion (US$ 25.87 billion) at present and is also expected to 

grow in the local market with aggressive rural penetration by drug makers, increased government 

spending on health, and growing health awareness among people. 

Pesticides & Agrochemicals

Page 45 of 371 
 

Indian crop protection industry is estimated at $ 4.25 billion in FY14 of which 50 per cent are exports. 

The crop protection industry has experienced strong growth in the past and is expected to grow further at 

12-13 per cent per annum to reach $ 7.5 billion by FY2018-19.  

Plastics & Petrochemicals  

The Plastics industry in India, growing at 10%, is set to double its per capita consumption in next 5 years 

to 16.5 mn tonnes by 2016, led by increasing level of usage in automobiles, consumer packaging and 

impact of increased infrastructure spending.  

Dyes & Pigments  

Indian dyes and pigments industry currently accounts for 5% of total chemicals market and is expected to 

grow at 8% p.a. over the next five years.  

Fine & Specialty Chemicals  

Specialty Chemicals are defined as a ―Group of relatively high value, low volume chemicals known for 

their end user applications or performance enhancing properties‖.  

Domestic demand of specialty chemicals is expected to follow an accelerated growth path. This demand 

is mostly driven by the strong growth outlook for end use industries. This along with increased adoption 

of specialty chemicals and usages can propel the growth further. Indian specialty chemical manufacturers 

have strong presence in export market also. The key specialty segments in India are agrochemicals, paints 

coating and construction chemicals, colorants, Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), personal care 

chemicals and flavors & fragrances. APIs and colorants including dyes and pigments are the key export 

oriented products. 

In India it has been growing rapidly at 1.2-1.3x of GDP growth rate (12%) over the last five years and 

currently stands at $ 21.5 Billion. 

Fertilizers  

The fertilizer demand in India is expected to grow at 3% CAGR from FY13 to reach 70 mn tonnes in 

FY18, higher than the global growth rate of 2% during the same period.  

The demand outlook for the fertilizer industry is positive for 2014-15. But a sluggish recovery is in the 

offing for the industry as it continues to face significant challenges and uncertainties, especially the gas 

price hike front.

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INDIAN CHEMICAL INDUSTRY 

 High Domestic Demand Potential 

 Focus on new segments such as specialty and knowledge chemicals 

 Gujarat and Maharashtra have emerged as most favoured zones 

 Fragmented Industry 

 Increase in focus on Research and Development 

As on 2015, the National Chemical Policy of India which is expected to help in improving the chemical 

industry is in final stages and as a part of this, the Government is planning to launch Indian Bureau of 

Corrosion Control and setting up National Chemical Centre that could prevent losses from corrosion and 

act as a repository information Center for the chemical industry. 

Strong economic growth and rise in per-capita income has meant a steady increase in demand for 

chemicals expected to clock a growth of 10-13 per cent over the coming years. The industry has left 

behind a low-growth and regulated environment to emerge more mature.

Regulations, as amended from time to time and the circulars issued by BSE and SEBI in this matter from 

time to time. 

Following is a summary of the key details pertaining to the Market Making arrangement: 

1. The Market Maker(s) (individually or jointly) shall be required to provide a 2-way quote for 75% of 

the time in a day. The same shall be monitored by the Stock Exchange. Further, the Market Maker(s) 

shall inform the Exchange in advance for each and every black out period when the quotes are not 

being offered by the Market Maker(s). 

2. The minimum depth of the quote shall be Rs. 1,00,000/-. However, the investors with holdings of 

value less than Rs. 1,00,000/- shall be allowed to offer their holding to the Market Maker(s) 

(individually or jointly) in that scrip provided that he sells his entire holding in that scrip in one lot 

along with a declaration to the effect to the selling broker. Based on the IPO price of 23/- the 

minimum lot size is 6,000 Equity Shares thus minimum depth of the quote shall be Rs. 1.00 Lakh/-

until the same, would be revised by BSE.  

3. After a period of three (3) months from the market making period, the Market Maker would be 

exempted to provide quote if the Shares of Market Maker in our Company reaches to 25% of Issue 

Size (including the 60,000 Equity Shares out to be allotted under this Issue). Any Equity Shares 

allotted to Market Maker under this Issue over and above 25% Equity Shares would not be taken in 

to consideration of computing the threshold of 25% of Issue Size. As soon as the Shares of Market 

Maker in our Company reduce to 24% of Issue Size, the Market Maker will resume providing 2-way 

quotes. 

4. There shall be no exemption/threshold on downside. However, in the event the Market Maker 

exhausts his inventory through market making process, BSE may intimate the same to SEBI after 

due verification. 

5. Execution of the order at the quoted price and quantity must be guaranteed by the Market Maker(s), 

for the quotes given by him. 



 

Page 61 of 371 
 

6. There would not be more than five Market Makers for the Company‘s Equity Shares at any point of 

time and the Market Makers may compete with other Market Makers for better quotes to the 

investors. At this stage, [●] is acting as the sole Market Maker. 

7. The shares of the Company will be traded in continuous trading session from the time and day the 

company gets listed on SME Platform of BSE and market maker will remain present as per the 

guidelines mentioned under BSE and SEBI circulars. 

8. .There will be special circumstances under which the Market Maker may be allowed to withdraw 

temporarily/fully from the market – for instance due to system problems, any other problems. All 

controllable reasons require prior approval from the Exchange, while force-majeure will be 

applicable for non controllable reasons. The decision of the Exchange for deciding controllable and 

non-controllable reasons would be final. 

9. The Market Maker(s) shall have the right to terminate said arrangement by giving one month notice 

or on mutually acceptable terms to the Lead Manager, who shall then be responsible to appoint a 

replacement Market Maker(s).

i. Details of Promoter‟s Contribution locked in for three years:  

Pursuant to Regulation 32 and 36 of SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, an aggregate of 20% of the post-Issue 

capital held by our Promoter shall be considered as Promoters‘ Contribution (―Promoters Contribution‖)

The Equity Shares that are being locked in are not ineligible for computation of Promoter‘s contribution 

in terms of Regulation 33 of the SEBI Regulations. In Connection, we confirm the following: 

a. The Equity Shares offered for minimum 20% Promoters‘ contribution have not been acquired in the 

three years preceding the date of this Draft Prospectus for consideration other than cash and 

revaluation of assets or capitalization of intangible assets nor resulted from a bonus issue out of the 

revaluation reserves or unrealized profits of the Company or against Equity Shares which are 

otherwise ineligible for computation of Promoters‘ contribution; 

b. The minimum Promoters‘ contribution does not include Equity Shares acquired during the one year 

preceding the date of this Draft Prospectus at a price lower than the Issue Price ; 

c. Our Company has not been formed by the conversion of a partnership firm into a Company and thus, 

no Equity Shares have been issued to our Promoters upon conversion of a partnership firm;  

d. The Equity Shares held by the Promoters and offered for minimum Promoters‘ contribution are not 

subject to any pledge; 



 

Page 72 of 371 

 

e. All the Equity Shares of our Company held by the Promoter are in the process of dematerialization; 

and 

f. The Equity Shares offered for Promoter‘s contribution do not consist of Equity Shares for which 

specific written consent has not been obtained from the Promoter for inclusion of its subscription in 

the Promoter‘s contribution subject to lock-in. 

ii. Details of Equity Shares locked-in for one year 

Other than the above Equity Shares that are locked in for three years, the entire pre-Issue Equity Share 

capital of our Company shall be locked-in for a period of one year from the date of allotment in the 

Public Issue. 

iii. Other requirements in respect of lock-in 

Pursuant to Regulation 39 of the SEBI ICDR Regulations, the locked-in Equity Shares held by the 

Promoter, as specified above, can be pledged only with scheduled commercial banks or public 

financial institutions as collateral security for loans granted by such scheduled commercial banks or 

public financial institution, provided that the pledge of the Equity Shares is one of the terms of the 

sanction of the loan. 

Provided that securities locked in as Promoter‘s Contribution for 3 years under Regulation 36(a) of the 

SEBI ICDR Regulations may be pledged only if, in addition to fulfilling the above requirement, the 

loan has been granted by such scheduled commercial bank or public financial institution for the 

purpose of financing one or more of the objects of the Issue. 

Further, pursuant to Regulation 40 of the SEBI ICDR Regulations, the Equity Shares held by persons 

other than the Promoters prior to the Issue may be transferred to any other person holding the Equity 

Shares which are locked-in as per Regulation 37 of the SEBI ICDR Regulations, along with the Equity 

Shares proposed to be transferred, provided that lock-in on such Equity Shares will continue for the 

remaining period with the transferee and such transferee shall not be eligible to transfer such Equity 

Shares till the lock-in period stipulated under the SEBI ICDR Regulations has ended, subject to 

compliance with the Takeover Code, as applicable 

We further confirm that our Promoter‘s Contribution of 20.51 % of the post Issue Equity Share capital 

does not include any contribution from Alternative Investment Fund.

BACKGROUND OF CHEMICAL INDUSTRY 

The chemical industry in India is a key constituent of Indian economy, accounting for about 2.11 per 

cent of the gross domestic product (GDP). In terms of volume of production, Indian chemical 

industry is the third largest producer in Asia and sixth largest in the world. 

Indian chemical industry generated business worth US$ 118 billion in 2014. Bulk chemicals account 

for 39 per cent of the Indian chemical industry, followed by agrochemicals (20.3 per cent) and 

specialty chemicals (19.5 per cent). Pharmaceuticals and biotechnology accounted for the remaining 

share. India‘s growing per capita consumption and demand for agriculture-related chemicals offers 

huge scope of growth for the sector in the future. Lured by the size and returns of the Indian market, 

foreign firms have strengthened their presence in India. From April 2000 to May 2015, total foreign 

direct investment (FDI) inflows into the Indian chemicals industry (excluding fertilisers) were US$ 

10.49 billion. 

The Government of India has been supportive to the sector. 100 per cent FDI is permissible in the 

Indian chemicals sector while manufacturing of most chemical products is de-licensed. The 

government has also been encouraging Research and Development (R&D) in the sector. Moreover, 

the government is continuously reducing the list of reserved chemical items for production in the 

small-scale sector, thereby facilitating greater investment in technology up-gradation and 

modernisation. 

The Government has launched the Draft National Chemical Policy, which aims to increase chemical 

sector‘s share in country‘s GDP.

APPROACH TO INDUSTRY ANALYSIS 

Analysis of Chemical Industry needs to be approached at both macro and micro levels, whether for 

domestic or global markets. Chemical Industry forms part of Manufacturing Sector at a macro level. 

Hence, broad picture of Manufacturing Sector should be at preface while analysing the Chemical 

Industry. 

Manufacturing sector comprises various industries, which in turn, have numerous sub-classes or 

products. One such major industry in the overall Manufacturing sector is ‗Chemical Industry‘, which 

in turn encompasses various components one of them being ‗Base Chemicals, Speciality Chemicals 

and Pharmaceuticals Segments‖. 

Thus, Base Chemicals, Speciality Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals Segments of Chemical Industry 

should be analysed in the light of ‗Chemical industry‘ at large. An appropriate view on Base 

http://www.ibef.org/


 

Page 121 of 371 

 

Chemicals, Speciality Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals Segments, then, calls for the overall economy 

outlook, performance and expectations of Manufacturing Sector, position of Chemical  Industry and 

micro analysis.

GLOBAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT 

INTRODUCTION 

Since the Economic Survey and Budget were presented a year ago, the Indian economy has continued 

to consolidate the gains achieved in restoring macro-economic stability. Inflation, the fiscal deficit, 

and the current account deficit have all declined, rendering India a relative haven of macro stability in 

these turbulent times. Economic growth appears to be recovering, albeit at varying speeds across 

sectors.  

At the same time, the upcoming Budget and 2016-17 (FY-2017) economic policy more broadly, will 

have to contend with an unusually challenging and weak external environment. Although the major 

international institutions are yet again predicting that global growth will increase from its current 

subdued level, they assess that risks remain tilted to the downside. This uncertain and fragile outlook 

will complicate the task of economic management for India. 

The risks merit serious attention not least because major financial crises seem to be occurring more 

frequently. The Latin American debt crisis of 1982, the Asian Financial crisis of the late 1990s, and 

the Eastern European crisis of 2008 suggested that crises might be occurring once a decade. But then 

the rapid succession of crises, starting with Global Financial Crisis of 2008and proceeding to the 

prolonged European crisis, the mini-crises of 2013, and the China provoked turbulence in 2015 all 

hinted that the intervals between events are becoming shorter.  



 

Page 122 of 371 

 

This hypothesis could be validated in the immediate future, since identifiable vulnerabilities exist in 

at least three large emerging economies—China, Brazil, Saudi Arabia—at a time when underlying 

growth and productivity developments in the advanced economies are soft. More flexible exchange 

rates, however, could moderate full-blown eruptions into less disruptive but more prolonged 

volatility. 

One tail risk scenario that India must plan for is a major currency re-adjustment in Asia in the wake 

of a similar adjustment in China; as such an event would spread deflation around the world. Another 

tail risk scenario could unfold as a consequence of policy actions—say, capital controls taken to 

respond to curb outflows from large emerging market countries, which would further moderate the 

growth impulses emanating from them. 

In either case, foreign demand is likely to be weak, forcing India—in the short run—to find and 

activate domestic sources of demand to prevent the growth momentum from weakening. At the very 

least, a tail risk event would require Indian monetary and fiscal policy not to add to the deflationary 

impulses from abroad. The consolation would be that weaker oil and commodity prices would help 

keep inflation and the twin deficits in check.

GLOBAL ECONOMIC OVERVIEW 

The global macroeconomic landscape is currently chartering a rough and uncertain terrain 

characterized by weak growth of world output. The situation has been exacerbated by; (i) declining 

prices of a number of commodities, with reduction in crude oil prices being the most visible of them, 

(ii) turbulent financial markets (more so equity markets), and (iii) volatile exchange rates. These 

conditions reflect extreme risk-aversion behaviour of global investors, thus putting many, and in 

particular, commodities exporting economies under considerable stress. 

One important positive outcome in 2015 is the modest pickup in the growth of some of the advanced 

economies. However, growth in emerging market and developing economies declined for the fifth 

consecutive year. As a result, overall global economic activity remained subdued in 2015. In its latest 

Update of the World Economic Outlook (WEO), published on 19 January 2016, the IMF projected 

growth in the global economy to improve from 3.1 per cent in 2015, to 3.4 per cent in 2016 and 

further to 3.6 per cent in 2017. Growth in advanced economies is projected at 2.1 per cent in 2016 

and to continue through 2017 at the same rate. 

The slowdown and rebalancing of the Chinese economy, lower commodity prices, and strains in 

some large Emerging Market and Developing economies (EMDE) are likely to continue to weigh on 

their growth prospects in 2016–17. Assessments indicate that mixed inflation developments in the 

EMDEs reflect the conflicting implications of weak domestic demand and lower commodity prices 

versus marked currency depreciations over the past year. The WEO update also indicated that India 

and the rest of emerging Asia are bright spots, with some other countries facing strong headwinds 

from China‘s economic rebalancing and global manufacturing weakness. World trade volume growth 

projections have been placed at 2.6 per cent and 3.4 per cent respectively for 2015 and 2016, which is 

much lower than what was estimated earlier in WEO in October 2015.

GLOBAL OUTLOOK FOR GROWTH 

One important positive outcome in 2015 was the modest pick-up in growth in some of the advanced 

economies. It might be recalled that after falling in 2009 due to the 2008 global financial crisis, 

growth in emerging and developing economies rebounded in 2010 and 2011. While advanced 

economies also exhibited a recovery in 2010 thanks to the large stimuli, global growth continued to 

http://www.indiabudget.nic.in/
http://www.indiabudget.nic.in/


 

Page 123 of 371 

 

be tepid relative to the average of the decade ending 2006, largely on account of the slowdown in 

advanced economies. Spill over effects of the crisis may have been large, prolonged and bi-

directional, given that the global integration is far greater than in the prior decade. This has made the 

task of projecting global economic outlook arduous. This uncertainty has led to the International 

Monetary Fund (IMF) revising the global growth outlook in its World Economic Outlook (WEO) 

four times a year since 2009. 

In its latest WEO Update, published on 19 January 2016, the IMF has projected growth in the global 

economy to go up from 3.1 per cent in 2015 to 3.4 per cent in 2016 and further to 3.6 per cent in 

2017, slightly lower than the projection published in October 2015. Growth in advanced economies is 

revised by 0.2 percentage points in 2016 to 2.1 per cent, to continue through 2017. Growth in the US 

is expected to remain resilient owing to strengthening of the housing and labour markets. Growth in 

the euro area is expected to increase due to stronger private consumption supported by lower oil 

prices and easy financial conditions is expected to outweigh the weakening in net exports. Growth in 

Japan is also expected to consolidate in 2016, on the back of fiscal support, lower oil prices, 

accommodative financial conditions, and rising incomes. 

Overall global economic activity remained subdued in 2015, as growth in emerging market and 

developing economies (EMDE) declined for the fifth consecutive year and recovery in advanced 

economies was modest. This is also attributable to the changing composition of the global economy 

and relative point contributions to global growth. The fall in the contribution of the EMDEs is not 

being made good by the advanced economies. A recent feature is that the Chinese economy is 

gradually slowing down and is transitioning from investment demand to consumption demand and 

from manufacturing to services. The concern over the spill over‘s of subdued global growth to other 

economies through trade channels and weaker commodity prices is manifest in diminishing 

confidence and increasing volatility in financial markets. In addition, a dual monetary policy-a 

gradual tightening in monetary policy in the US in the backdrop of its resilient recovery and easy 

monetary policy in several other major advanced economies has led to continued uncertainties and 

poses challenges for the year ahead. In the case of EMDEs, growth remained subdued at 4 per cent in 

2015, but is projected to increase to 4.3 per cent in 2016 and 4.7 per cent in 2017. The slowdown and 

rebalancing of the Chinese economy, lower commodity prices, and strains in some large emerging 

market economies will continue to weigh on growth prospects in 2016–17. Assessments indicate that 

mixed inflation developments in EMDEs reflect the conflicting implications of weak domestic 

demand and lower commodity prices versus marked currency depreciations over the past year. 

The 19 January WEO Update also indicated that India and the rest of emerging Asia are bright spots, 

albeit with some countries facing strong headwinds from China‘s economic rebalancing and global 

manufacturing weakness. The IMF‘s growth forecast for India is 7.5 per cent in 2016 and 2017 and 

this surpasses the projection of 6.3 per cent and 6.0 per cent respectively for China. The level of 

global economic activity has a significant and direct bearing on the growth prospects of the emerging 

economies through trade channels. As per the Update, world trade volume growth projections have 

been placed at 3.4 per cent and 4.1 per cent respectively for 2016 and 2017 lower by 0.7 percentage 

points to 0.5 percentage point respectively from WEO, October 2015. The World Bank‘s Report on 

Global Economic Prospects (January 2016) also estimated that India will grow by a robust 7.8 per 

cent in 2016 and 7.9 per cent in the following two years. Compared to other major developing 

countries, the report maintained that India is well positioned to withstand near-term headwinds and 

volatility in global financial markets due to reduced external vulnerabilities, a strengthening domestic 

business cycle, and a supportive policy environment.

THE INDIAN ECONOMY  

The Indian economy has continued to consolidate the gains achieved in restoring macroeconomic 

stability. A sense of this turnaround is illustrated by a cross-country comparison. In last year‘s 

Survey, we had constructed an overall index of macroeconomic vulnerability, which adds a country‘s 

fiscal deficit, current account deficit, and inflation. This index showed that in 2012 India was the 

most vulnerable of the major emerging market countries. Subsequently, India has made the most 

dramatic strides in reducing its macro-vulnerability. Since 2013, its index has improved by 5.3 

percentage points compared with 0.7 percentage points for China, 0.4 percentage points for all 

countries in India‘s investment grade (BBB), and a deterioration of 1.9 percentage points in the case 

of Brazil (Figure 2). 

If macro-economic stability is one key element of assessing a country‘s attractiveness to investors, its 

growth rate is another. In last year‘s Survey we had constructed a simple Rational Investor Ratings 

Index (RIRI) which combined two elements, growth serving as a gauge for rewards and the macro-

economic vulnerability index proxying for risks. The RIRI is depicted in Figure 3; higher levels 

indicate better performance. As can be seen, India performs well not only in terms of the change of 

the index but also in terms of the level, which compares favourably to its peers in the BBB 

investment grade and even its ―betters‖ in the A grade1.As an investment proposition, India stands 

out internationally.

REVIEW OF MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS IN INDIAN ECONOMY 

In the Advance Estimates of GDP that the Central Statistics Office (CSO) released recently, the 

growth rate of GDP at constant market prices is projected to increase to 7.6 per cent in 2015-16 from 

7.2 per cent in 2014-15, mainly because private final consumption expenditure has accelerated. 

Similarly, the growth rate of GVA for 2015-16 is estimated at 7.3 per cent vis-à-vis 7.1 per cent in 

2014-15. Although agriculture is likely to register low growth for the second year in a row on account 

of weak monsoons, it has performed better than last year. Industry has shown significant 

improvement primarily on account of the surprising acceleration in manufacturing (9.5 per cent vis-à-

vis 5.5 per cent in 2014-15). Meanwhile, services continue to expand rapidly. 

 Even as real growth has been accelerating, nominal growth has been falling, to historically 

low levels, an unusual trend highlighted in the Mid-Year Economic Analysis (MYEA), 2015-

16. 

 According to the Advance Estimates, nominal GDP (GVA) is likely to increase by just 8.6 

(6.8) percent in 2015-16.  

http://www.indiabudget.nic.in/
http://www.indiabudget.nic.in/


 

Page 125 of 371 

 

 In nominal terms, construction is expected to stagnate, while even the dynamic sectors of 

trade and finance are projected to grow by only 7 to 73/4 percent. 

 Inflation remains under control The CPI-New Series inflation has fluctuated around 51/2 

percent, while measures of underlying trends—core inflation, rural wage growth and 

minimum support price increases—have similarly remained muted. Meanwhile, the WPI has 

been in negative territory since November 2014, the result of the large falls in international 

commodity prices, especially oil. As low inflation has taken hold and confidence in price 

stability has improved, gold imports have largely stabilized, notwithstanding the end of a 

period of import controls 

 Similarly, the external position appears robust. The current account deficit has declined and 

is at comfortable levels; foreign exchange reserves have risen to US$351.5 billion in early 

February 2016, and are well above standard norms for reserve adequacy; net FDI inflows 

have grown from US$21.9 billion in April-December 2014-15 to US$27.7 billion in the same 

period of 2015-16; and the nominal value of the rupee, measured against a basket of 

currencies, has been steady. India was consequently well-positioned to absorb the volatility 

from the U.S. Federal Reserve actions to normalize monetary policy that occurred in 

December 2015. Although the rupee has declined against the dollar, it has strengthened 

against the currencies of its other trading partners. 

 The fiscal sector registered three striking successes: on-going fiscal consolidation, improved 

indirect tax collection efficiency; and an improvement in the quality of spending at all levels 

of government. 

 Government tax revenues are expected to be higher than budgeted levels. Direct taxes grew 

by 10.7 per cent in the first 9 months (9M) of 2015-16. Indirect taxes were also buoyant. In 

part, this reflected excise taxes on diesel and petrol and an increase in the Swachh Bharat 

cess. The central excise duty collection from petroleum products during April to December 

2015-16 recorded a growth of 90.5 per cent and stood at Rs.1.3 lakh crore as against Rs. 0.7 

lakh crore in the same period last year. Tax performance also reflected an improvement in tax 

administration because revenues increased even after stripping out the additional revenue 

measures (ARMs). Indirect tax revenues grew by 10.7 per cent (without ARMs) and 34.2 per 

cent (with ARMs). 

 The main findings are that a welcome shift in the quality of spending has occurred from 

revenue to investment, and towards social sectors. Aggregate public investment has increased 

by about 0.6 per cent of GDP in the first 8 months of this fiscal year, with contributions from 

both the Centre (54 per cent) and states (46 per cent).

DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CAPITAL MARKET 

PRIMARY MARKET 

In 2015-16 (April-December), resource mobilization through the public and right issues has surged 

rapidly as compared to the last financial year. During 2015-16 (April- December), 71 companies have 

accessed the capital market and raised Rs.51,311 crore, compared to Rs.11,581 crore raised through 

61 issues during the corresponding period of 2014-15. 

The small and medium enterprises (SME) platform of the stock exchange is intended for small and 

medium sized companies with high growth potential, whose post issue paid-up capital is less than or 

equal to Rs. 25 crore. During 2015-16 (April- December), 32 companies were listed on the SME 

http://www.indiabudget.nic.in/


 

Page 126 of 371 

 

platform, raising a total amount of Rs.278 crore as compared to Rs.229 crore raised through 28 issues 

in the corresponding period of 2014-15. 

Resources mobilized by mutual funds during April-December 2015 also increased substantially to 

Rs.1,61,696 crore from Rs.87,942crore mobilized during the same period of the previous year.  

SECONDARY MARKET 

During 2015-16 so far, the Indian securities market has remained subdued (Figure 3.9). The Bombay 

Stock Exchange (BSE) Sensex declined by 8.5 per cent (upto 5 January 2016) over end-March 2015, 

mainly on account of turmoil in global equity markets in August 2015 following slowdown in China 

and its currency devaluation and slump in stocks. On 4 January 2016, weak Chinese manufacturing 

data again led to a global sell-off which caused the BSE Sensex also to decline by 538 points (2.1per 

cent).The downward trend in the Indian stock market was also guided by mixed corporate earnings 

for Q1 and Q2 of 2015- 16, FPIs‘ concern over minimum alternative tax (MAT), weakening of the 

rupee against the US dollar, investor concern over delay in passage of the Goods and Services 

Tax(GST) Bill, uncertainty over interest rate hike by US Fed and selling by FPIs. However, the 

Indian equity market has been relatively resilient during this period compared to the other major 

EMEs. The Indian stock market withstood the US Fed increase in interest rates in December 2015.

INDUSTRIAL PERFORMANCE 

The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) which provides quick estimates of the performance of key 

industrial sectors has started showing upward momentum (Figure 6.1). As per IIP, the industrial 

sector broadly comprising mining, manufacturing and electricity attained 3.1 per cent growth during 

April-December 2015-16 as compared to 2.6 per cent during the same period of 2014- 15 due to the 

higher growth in mining and manufacturing sectors (Table 6.1). The mining, manufacturing and 

electricity sectors grew by 2.3 per cent, 3.1 per cent, and 4.5 per cent respectively during April-

December 2015-16. The mining sector growth was mainly on account of higher coal production. The 

manufacturing sector was propelled by the higher production by the industry groups like furniture; 

wearing apparel, dressing and dyeing of fur; motor vehicles, trailers & semitrailers; chemicals and 

chemical products; refined petroleum products & nuclear fuel; and wood& products of wood. The 

growth in electricity is mainly contributed by higher growth in generation of thermal and nuclear 

sector. 

http://www.indiabudget.nic.in/


 

Page 127 of 371 

 

In terms of use based classification, consumer durable goods have witnessed a remarkable growth at 

12.4 per cent during April-December 2015-16. Basic goods and capital goods have registered 3.4 per 

cent and 1.7 per cent growth with intermediate goods by 1.9 per cent (Table 6.1). 

The eight core infrastructure supportive industries, coal, crude oil, natural gas, refinery products, 

fertilizers, steel, cement and electricity that have a total weight of nearly 38 per cent in the IIP, 

registered a cumulative growth of 1.9 per cent during April-December 2015-16 as compared to 5.7 

per cent during April-December 2014-15. Month-wise performance of the eight core sectors shows 

that the production of coal and fertilizers have increased substantially, while that of crude oil, natural 

gas and steel have mostly been negative. Refinery products, cement and electricity have attained 

moderate growth. Clearances for coal projects have facilitated production of coal. Crude oil and 

natural gas production declined because of a fall in production by Oil and Natural Gas Corporation 

(ONGC), Oil India Limited (OIL) and also private/joint venture (JV) companies in different months. 

In electricity generation, while the thermal and nuclear sectors have registered higher growth, the 

hydro sector has not performed well. 

 

Figure 6.1 depicts three months moving average month-on-month (M-o-M) growth of the IIP, 

manufacturing and eight core industries. The growth in industrial production, manufacturing sector 

and the eight core sectors started picking up again in December 2015. It is expected that the uptick in 

growth rate will be maintained due to revival in manufacturing production. 

While the overall IIP has shown recovery, there is variation in the performance of some of the major 

industries during April-December 2015. While some sectors like electricity, coal, fertilizers, cement 

and passenger cars have shown positive growth, sectors like steel and aluminium have shown 

negative growth during April-December 2015.

MICRO SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES SECTOR 

With 3.6 crore units spread across the country, that employ 8.05 crore people, Micro, Small and 

Medium Enterprises (MSME) have a contribution of 37.5 per cent to the country‘s GDP. The sector 



 

Page 128 of 371 

 

has huge potential for helping address structural problems like unemployment, regional imbalances, 

unequal distribution of national income and wealth across the country. Due to comparatively low 

capital costs and their forward-backward linkages with other sectors, MSMEs will play a crucial role 

in the success of the Make in India initiative. 

Realizing the importance of the MSME sector, the government has undertaken a number of 

schemes/programmes like the Prime Minister‘s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP), 

Credit Guarantee Trust Fund for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE), Credit Linked Capital 

Subsidy Scheme (CLCSS) for Technology Up gradation, Scheme of Fund for Regeneration of 

Traditional Industries (SFURTI), and Micro and Small Enterprises- Cluster Development Programme 

(MSECDP) for the establishment of new enterprises and development of existing ones. Some of the 

new initiatives undertaken by the government for the promotion and development of MSMEs, are as 

follows: 

 Udyog Aadhar Memorandum (UAM): The UAM scheme, which was notified in 

September 2015 under section 8 of the MSME Development Act 2006, is a path-breaking 

step to promote ease of doing business for MSMEs. Under the scheme, MSME entrepreneurs 

just need to file an online entrepreneurs‘ memorandum to instantly get a unique Udyog 

Aadhaar Number (UAN). The information sought is on self-certification basis and no 

supporting documents are required. This marks a significant improvement over the earlier 

complex and cumbersome procedure. 

 Employment Exchange for Industries: To facilitate match making between prospective job 

seekers and employers an employment exchange for industries was launched on June 15, 

2015 in line with Digital India. More than 3.42 lakh job seekers have been registered on the 

portal as on December 30, 2015. 

 Framework for Revival and Rehabilitation of MSMEs: Under this framework, which was 

notified in May 2015, banks have to constitute a Committee for Distressed MSME 

enterprises at zonal or district level to prepare a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) for these units. 

 A scheme for Promoting Innovation and Rural Entrepreneurs (ASPIRE): ASPIRE was 

launched on March 16, 2015 with the objective of setting up a network of technology centres 

and incubation centres to accelerate entrepreneurship and promote start-ups for innovation 

and entrepreneurship in rural and agriculture based industry. 

In addition, the government intends to provide more credit to MSME sectors, especially in the rural 

areas, focusing on skill development, encouraging entrepreneurial activities with optimistic mindset 

among rural youth and creating job opportunities among rural women, for high, inclusive and 

sustained industrial growth

OUTLOOK FOR GROWTH 

Real GDP growth for 2015-16 is expected to be in the 7 to 73/4range, reflecting various and largely 

offsetting developments on the demand and supply sides of the Indian economy. Before analysing 

these factors, however, it is important to step back and note one important point. India‘s long-run 

potential GDP growth is substantial, about 8-10 percent. But its actual growth in the short run will 

also depend upon global growth and demand. After all, India‘s exports of manufactured goods and 

services now constitute about 18 percent of GDP, up from about 11 percent a decade ago. 

Reflecting India‘s growing globalization, the correlation between India‘s growth rate and that of the 

world has risen sharply to reasonably high levels. For the period 1991-2002 this correlation was 0.2. 

http://www.indiabudget.nic.in/


 

Page 129 of 371 

 

Since then, the correlation has doubled to 0.42. In other words, a 1 percentage point decrease in the 

world growth rate is now associated with a 0.42 percentage point decrease in Indian growth rates. 

Accordingly, if the world economy remains weak, India‘s growth will face considerable headwinds. 

For example, if the world continues to grow at close to 3 percent over the next few years rather than 

returning to the buoyant 4-4½ per cent recorded during 2003-2011, India‘s medium-term growth 

trajectory could well remain closer to 7-7½ per cent, notwithstanding the government‘s reform 

initiatives, rather than rise to the 8-10 per cent that its long-run potential suggests. In other words, in 

the current global environment, there needs to be a recalibration of growth expectations and 

consequently of the standards of assessment. 

Turning to the outlook for 2016-17, we need to examine each of the components of aggregate 

demand: exports, consumption, private investment and government. 

 To measure the demand for India‘s exports, we calculate a proxy-weighted average GDP 

growth rate of India‘s export partners. The weights are the shares of partner countries in 

India‘s exports of goods and services. We find that this proxy for export demand growth 

declined from 3.0 percent in 2014 to 2.7 per cent in 2015, which helps explain the 

deceleration in India‘s non-oil exports, although the severity of the slowdown—in fact, a 

decline in export volume—went beyond adverse external developments. Current projections 

by the IMF indicate that trading partner growth this demand will improve marginally this 

year to about 2.8 percent. But the considerable downside risks suggest that it would be 

prudent not to count on a big contribution to GDP growth from improving export 

performance. 

 On the domestic side, two factors could boost consumption. If and to the extent that the 

Seventh Pay Commission (7th PC) is implemented, increased spending from higher wages 

and allowances of government workers will start flowing through the economy. If, in 

addition, the monsoon returns to normal, agricultural incomes will improve, with attendant 

gains for rural consumption, which over the past two years of weak rains has remained 

depressed. 

 Against this, the disappearance of much of last year‘s oil windfall would work to reduce 

consumption growth. Current prospects suggest that oil prices (Indian crude basket) might 

average US$ 35 per barrel next fiscal year compared with US$ 45 per barrel in 2015-16. The 

resulting income gain would amount roughly equivalent to 1 percentage point of GDP – an 

18 per cent price decline times a share of net oil imports in GDP of 6 percent. But this would 

be half the size of last year‘s gain, so consumption growth would slow on this account next 

year. 

 According to analysis done by Credit Suisse, (non-financial) corporate sector profitability has 

remained weak, falling by 1 percent in the year to December 2015.This decline reflected a 

sharp deterioration in the financial health of the metals—primarily steel—companies, which 

have now joined the ranks of companies under severe financial stress. As a result, the 

proportion of corporate debt owed by stressed companies, defined as those whose earnings 

are insufficient to cover their interest obligations, has increased to 41 percent in December 

2015, compared to 35 percent in December 2014.3 In response to this stress, companies have 

once again been compelled to curb their capital expenditures substantially. 

 Finally, the path for fiscal consolidation will determine the demand for domestic output from 

government. The magnitude of the drag on demand and output will be largely equal to the 

size of consolidation, assuming a multiplier of about 1.

 There are three significant downside risks. Turmoil in the global economy could worsen the 

outlook for exports and tighter financial conditions significantly. Second, if contrary to 

expectations oil prices rise more than anticipated, this would increase the drag from 

consumption, both directly, and owing to reduced prospects for monetary easing. Finally, the 

most serious risk is a combination of the above two factors. This could arise if oil markets are 

dominated by supply-related factors such as agreements to restrict output by the major 

producers. 

 The one significant upside possibility is a good monsoon. This would increase rural 

consumption and, to the extent that it dampens price pressures, open up further space for 

monetary easing. 

 Putting these factors together, we expect real GDP growth to be in the 7 to 7 3/4 per cent 

range, with downside risks because of on-going developments in the world economy. The 

wider range in the forecast this time reflects the range of possibilities for exogenous 

developments, from a rebound in agriculture to a full-fledged international crisis; it also 

reflects uncertainty arising from the divergence between growth in nominal and real 

aggregates of economic activity.

INDIA‟S INCREASING IMPORTANCE TO GLOBAL GROWTH  

Despite global headwinds and a truant monsoon, India registered robust growth of 7.2 per cent in 

2014-15 and 7.6 per cent in 2015-16, thus becoming the fastest growing major economy in the world. 

As per the estimates of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), global growth averaged 3.1 per cent 

in 2015, declining from 3.4 per cent registered in 2014. While growth in advanced economies has 

improved modestly since 2013, the emerging economies have witnessed a consistently declining 

trend in growth rate since 2010. It is against this background that the recent Indian growth story 

appears particularly bright. 

India has made striking progress in its contribution to the global growth of Gross Domestic Product 

(GDP) in Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) terms. PPP represents the number of units of a country's 

currency required to purchase the same amount of goods and services in the domestic market as the 

US dollar would purchase in the United States, thus adjusting for purchasing power differentials 

between currencies in relevant markets. India‘s contribution to global growth in PPP terms increased 

from an average of 8.3 per cent during the period 2001 to 2007 to 14.4 per cent in 2014. During the 

1990s, the US‘s contribution to the global GDP growth in PPP terms was, on an average, around 16 

percentage points higher than India‘s. The picture changed dramatically in 2013 and 2014 when 

India‘s contribution was higher than that of the US by 2.2 and 2.7 percentage points respectively. 

During 1991-2014, low growth in Japan (0.9 per cent annually) resulted in its low contribution (1.5 

per cent) to global growth. India and China constitute 42.5 per cent and 53.2 per cent respectively of 

the total PPP measure of the lower-middle income countries and upper-middle income countries; and 

hence those country groups largely reflect India‘s and China‘s patterns. 

The global economy—in particular the global growth powerhouse, China—is rebalancing, leading to 

an increasing role for India. After the onset of the multiple crises in different parts of the world, 

India‘s contribution has become much more valuable to the global economy. 

India‘s share in world GDP has increased from an average of 4.8 per cent during 2001-07 to 6.1 per 

cent during 2008-13 and further to an average of 7.0 per cent during 2014 to 2015 in current PPP 

terms (IMF). India‘s resilience and current levels of reasonably strong growth should, thus, be 

appreciated in the light of its increasing contribution to global growth.

GLOBAL MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY 

World manufacturing growth in the fourth quarter of 2015 

World manufacturing growth slowed down further in the fourth quarter of 2015, with growth rates in 

both industrialized and developing economies decreasing. Weak business investment and sluggish 

consumer demand are among the major causes of the deceleration of global manufacturing output 

growth.  

Growth in major emerging industrial economies has weakened, continuing the trend of the first 

quarter of 2014.China‘s slowdown and the sharp decline in manufacturing output of Latin American 

economies are the primary causes for the country group‘s weaker growth rate. The fall in commodity 

prices has affected some key emerging commodity export-dependent countries, namely Brazil and 

South Africa, and has resulted in currency depreciation. 

 

(Source: World Manufacturing Production- Statistics for Quarter IV, 2015; United Nations 

Industrial Development Organisation - www.unido.org) 

The upturn in manufacturing growth observed in industrialized economies in the third quarter of 2015 

did not continue in the fourth quarter of 2015, and this country group‘s production output decreased 

significantly. The slowdown in Europe and North America, along with a further decline in East Asian 

economies, resulted in a sharp deceleration in the country group‘s manufacturing output growth. In 

the United States, manufacturing exports slowed as a result of the strong US dollar and the low oil 

prices. Continued decline in China has also weakened Chinese demand for imports from Europe. 

Global manufacturing output growth rose by merely 1.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2015, down 

from a 2.6 per cent revised growth estimate in the third quarter. Slow investment growth, lower 

commodity and energy prices, weak global demand and geopolitical tensions are among the main 

causes of the overall flat-lining growth. However, these factors are having different effects on 

different economies. For example, favourable oil prices have reduced the business costs in oil 

importing countries, especially in industrialized economies, while oil exporting economies have been 

subject to increasing financial pressure. 

The manufacturing output of industrialized countries rose by 0.2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 

2015. This slow growth is attributable to a mixture of weaker growth figures in the United States and 

http://www.indiabudget.nic.in/
http://www.unido.org/


 

Page 132 of 371 

 

Europe and a decline in East Asia‘s manufacturing output. The question of the robustness of recovery 

in industrialized economies has been raised in earlier quarterly reports. 

The growth of manufacturing output in developing and emerging industrial economies decreased to 

4.6 per cent, down from 5.2 per cent growth in the previous quarter. The growth outlook varies 

between different developing and emerging regions and groups; e.g. manufacturing output grew by 

6.1 per cent in developing countries in Asia and the Pacific compared to the same period of the 

previous year, while it declined by 4.0 per cent in the Latin America region. Manufacturing output 

has also declined slightly (0.2 per cent) in Africa. 

Despite the slower pace of growth, developing and emerging industrial economies were the main 

drivers of global manufacturing growth. Their combined contribution to global manufacturing growth 

was around 80 per cent. This indicates the significance of manufacturing activities within the group 

for the overall global picture. 

(Source: World Manufacturing Production- Statistics for Quarter IV, 2015; United Nations 

Industrial Development Organisation - www.unido.org) 

Industrialized economies 

The overall growth trend of industrialized countries decelerated significantly in the last quarter of 

2015. Manufacturing output rose by a mere 0.2 per cent compared to the same period of the previous 

year, down from 1.0 per cent growth observed in the previous quarter. 

The European economy grew by 0.6 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the same 

quarter of the previous year. Yet, the manufacturing output of the euro zone economies rose by 1.5 

per cent. As revealed by the figures, Switzerland recorded a 14.7 per cent decline in manufacturing 

output and dragged down the overall growth rate of industrialized Europe. The consequences of the 

Swiss franc-euro exchange rate became more visible in the last two quarters of 2015 and have 

affected the country‘s exports, which have become more expensive for consumers. 

The industrial production index in North America rose by 0.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2015 

on account of the growth of manufacturing output in the Unites States. Despite this, the growth of the 

US manufacturing sector has weakened, rising by only 1.1 per cent as overseas demand remained 

slow. A strong US dollar hit exports and domestic sales of American manufactured products, 

indicating a loss in competitiveness to cheaper imported goods. In addition, demand for machinery 

goods from the energy sector declined due to lower oil prices. Manufacturing output dropped by 1.0 

per cent in Canada due to the decline in petroleum and coal prices. 

In East Asia, negative growth rates were observed in the major economies, namely Japan, the 

Republic of Korea and Singapore, in the fourth quarter of 2015, declining by 0.6 per cent, 0.6 per 

cent and 6.8 per cent, respectively. On the other hand, manufacturing output rose by 4.9 per cent in 

Malaysia compared to the same period of the previous year. 

As already mentioned, Europe‘s overall growth rate was dragged down by a significant decline in the 

Swiss economy. This has increased the gap between the output growth of the euro zone and of 

Europe as a whole, with euro zone countries registering a much higher manufacturing growth due to 

lower energy prices and a weaker euro. Growth was especially strong in Ireland (15.7 per cent), in 

Slovakia (7.3 per cent) and in Spain (5.8 per cent). 

Across non-euro countries, manufacturing output declined in Norway, Switzerland and the United 

Kingdom. The downturn in Norway by 7.6 per cent is attributed to a decrease in the production of 

oil- and gas-related industries. The setback in the UK‘s manufacturing sector by 1.0 per cent resulted 

from a strong currency and weak global demand. At the same time, the output of manufacturing 

activities increased by 3.9 per cent in the Czech Republic, by 9.4 per cent in Hungary, and 3.7 per 

http://www.unido.org/

cent in Sweden in the fourth quarter of 2015. The manufacture of motor vehicles was the main driver 

of growth in Hungary‘s manufacturing sector. 

The decline in the Russian Federation‘s manufacturing sector continued, with output decreasing by 

5.7 per cent and currency depreciation deteriorating. 

Despite the overall positive growth in industrialized economies as a whole, growth rates remained 

low. Appropriate monetary policies are required that can boost demand and increase investment. 

   

(Source: World Manufacturing Production- Statistics for Quarter IV, 2015; United Nations 

Industrial Development Organisation - www.unido.org) 

Developing and emerging industrial economies 

A decrease in the growth rate of manufacturing output in developing and emerging industrial 

economies continued in the fourth quarter of 2015. Industrial production rose by 4.6 per cent as a 

result of the relatively lower growth in Asian economies (mainly China) and a notable decline in 

Latin America. Growth in emerging economies, excluding China, continued to decelerate. 

As mentioned in earlier reports, China is in a transition period of shifting its economy from the 

manufacturing sector towards the services sector. As a result of the structural change in the economy, 

China‘s manufacturing output rose by 6.5 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2015, the slowest growth 

rate since 2005 and down from 7.0 per cent in the previous quarter. Recently, the Government of 

China announced the two-child policy, which could accelerate economic growth in the near future. 

This will significantly boost internal demand for consumer goods within the country. 

The Latin America region is struggling to overcome a deep recession as demonstrated by the decline 

in manufacturing output by 4.0 per cent in the fourth quarter, lower than the 2.9 per cent drop 

recorded in the previous quarter. The industrial production index decreased in nearly all economies 

with the exception of Mexico, where output grew by 2.2 per cent on a year-to-year basis. In Brazil, 

the recession continued and manufacturing output fell by 12.4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2015 

as the internal political crisis remained unresolved and commodity prices declined. Among the other 

major economies in the region, manufacturing output dropped by 0.9 per cent in Argentina, by 1.5 

per cent in Chile, by 0.4 per cent in Columbia and by 0.8 per cent in Peru. 

Manufacturing output fell slightly in Africa (by 0.2 per cent), however, negative growth has only 

been observed in one country in the region while the rest of the region registered positive growth 

figures. Manufacturing output grew by 1.1 per cent in Egypt, by 0.4 per cent in Morocco, by 5.8 per 

http://www.unido.org/

cent in Senegal and by 0.8 per cent in Tunisia. A decline of 1.4 per cent was registered in South 

Africa where the economy—as an exporter—has been hit by the low commodity prices. 

Among other developing countries, a strong growth of 12.4 per cent was registered by Viet Nam. 

Industrial production also grew by 5.3 per cent in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the fourth quarter of 

2015 on a year-to-year basis.

Industrial Development Organisation - www.unido.org) 

Key Findings on World Manufacturing Sector 

On a year-to-year comparison, world manufacturing production grew in all manufacturing sectors in 

the fourth quarter 2015, with the exception of the manufacture of machinery and equipment and 

printing and publishing. The global decline in the production output of the manufacture of machinery 

is attributable to low energy prices. Higher growth rates have been observed in the manufacture of 

radio and television and of chemicals and chemical products. Growth was positive across all 

industries in developing and emerging industrial economies, except a slight decline in the 

manufacture of motor vehicles. Industrialized countries registered negative growth in eight 

manufacturing industries. 

Among the consumer goods production industries, output of wearing apparel grew by 2.2 per cent in 

developing and emerging markets and by 0.6 per cent in the industrialized country group. The 

industry‘s output grew by 16.9 per cent in the Czech Republic, by 14.6 per cent in the United 

Kingdom, by 12.8 per cent in Egypt, and by 12.3 per cent in Mexico. However, the manufacturing 

output of the wearing apparel fell sharply in Brazil and Indonesia, by 12.9 per cent and 16.4 per cent, 

respectively. A significant decline was also observed in wearing apparel production in Canada and 

Estonia. The production of textiles grew by 4.1 per cent in developing countries while industrialized 

countries registered a decline of 0.5 per cent in this production. At country level, impressive growth 

in textiles production was recorded in Argentina, Estonia and Hungary whereas it dropped sharply in 

Brazil and Senegal. The production of food and beverages grew at a higher rate (5.2 per cent) in 

developing countries. As such, output grew by 7.8 per cent in China, by 7.3 per cent in Indonesia and 

by 5.2 per cent in Romania. Output declined by 10.3 per cent in Tunisia and by 7.0 per cent in Egypt. 

The food sector was the only manufacturing industry with a positive, albeit poor, growth in Brazil. 

The notable growth rate of 10.4 per cent was observed in the manufacture of radio, television and 

communication equipment in developing and emerging countries, with China, Egypt and India being 

the leading manufacturers. In industrialized markets, the highest growth rate in this manufacturing 

sector was seen in France. 

The production of motor vehicles fell marginally by 0.4 per cent in developing countries, attributed 

mainly to the decline in the industry in Latin American economies. The industry‘s output rose by 4.4 

per cent in industrialized countries, with Italy, Spain and Sweden being the top producers worldwide 

in the fourth quarter of 2015. The manufacturing production of other transport equipment increased at 

a higher rate in developing countries. 

The manufacture of chemicals and chemical products increased considerably in China, Senegal and 

Tunisia, as well as in Ireland, Netherlands and the Russian Federation. The chemical industry was 

one of the few industries in the Russian Federation recording a higher growth rate, with a 6.6 per cent 

increase compared to the previous year. 

The production of basic metals, which includes the production of basic iron, basic steel, basic 

precious and non-ferrous metals, rose by 5.9 per cent in developing countries compared to the same 

period of the previous year, but dropped by 4.8 per cent in industrialized countries in comparison to 

http://www.unido.org/

the previous year. Manufacturing output grew in China, Indonesia and Macedonia, while it fell in all 

Latin American economies and in Africa. 

In the United States, as the largest driver of growth in industrialized economies, the manufacture of 

electrical machinery and apparatus and motor vehicles remained strong in the fourth quarter of 2015. 

However, other industries showed either a decline or a decrease in production output. The 

combination of low energy prices and expensive currency contributed to the economic slowdown of 

the United States. Despite its slow economic growth, China‘s manufacturing output in most industries 

increased compared to the same period of the previous year. China recorded its highest growth rates 

in the manufacture of radio and television (10.1 per cent), chemicals and chemical products (9.8 per 

cent) and the manufacture of basic metals (8.9 per cent).

INDIAN MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY 

Introduction 

The Prime Minister of India, Mr Narendra Modi, has launched the ‗Make in India‘ initiative to place 

India on the world map as a manufacturing hub and give global recognition to the Indian economy. 

The Government of India has set an ambitious target of increasing the contribution of manufacturing 

output to 25 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2025, from 16 per cent currently. 

http://www.unido.org/


 

Page 137 of 371 

 

Market Size 

India‘s manufacturing sector could touch US$ 1 trillion by 2025. There is potential for the sector to 

account for 25-30 per cent of the country‘s GDP and create up to 90 million domestic jobs by 2025. 

Business conditions in the Indian manufacturing sector continue to remain positive. 

In November 2015, the seasonally adjusted Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index 

(PMI) stood at 50.3, which indicated expansion for twenty-fifth consecutive month. The services PMI 

was at 50.1 points in November 2015. 

Investments 

In a major boost to the 'Make in India' initiative, the Government of India has received investment 

proposals of over US$ 3.05 billion till end of August 2015 from various companies. 

India has become one of the most attractive destinations for investments in the manufacturing sector. 

Some of the major investments and developments in this sector in the recent past are: 

 Canada‘s Magna International Incorporated has started production at two facilities in 

Gujarat‘s Sanand, which will supply auto parts to Ford Motor Co in India and will employ 

around 600 people at both units. 

 Swedish home furnishing brand Ikea has made a long-term plan of opening 25 stores in India 

by making an investment worth Rs 12,500 crore (US$ 1.9 billion). 

 Siemens has announced that it will invest € 1 billion (US$ 1.13 billion) in India to add 4,000 

jobs to its existing workforce of 16,000 in the country. 

 US-based First Solar Inc. and China‘s Trina Solar have plans to set up manufacturing 

facilities in India. Clean energy investments in India increased to US$ 7.9 billion in 2014, 

helping the country maintain its position as the seventh largest clean energy investor in the 

world. 

 Samsung Electronics has invested Rs 517 crore (US$ 77.82 million) towards the expansion of 

its manufacturing plant in Noida, Uttar Pradesh (UP). ―Samsung India Electronics is 

committed to strengthen its manufacturing infrastructure and will gradually expand capacity 

at this plant to meet the growing domestic demand for mobile handsets, as per the company. 

 Shantha Biotechnics Private Limited has started building a facility to manufacture Insuman, 

an insulin product to treat diabetes. Sanofi SA, which acquired Shantha Biotechnics, will 

invest Rs 460 crore (US$ 69.24 million) to build the facility. 

 BMW and Mercedes-Benz have intensified their localisation efforts to be part of ‗Make in 

India‘ initiative. "The localisation efforts will reduce the waiting period and accelerate the 

servicing process of our cars as we had to (previously) depend on our plants overseas for 

supply and will help us on the pricing front.‖ 

 Suzuki Motor Corp plans to make automobiles for Africa, the company‘s next big bet, as 

well as for India at its upcoming factory in Hansalpur, near Ahmedabad, Gujarat. 

 Taiwan-based HTC has decided to manufacture products in India. HTC is believed to have 

partnered GDN Enterprises, which has an assembly set up in Noida. 

 Foxconn is planning an aggressive expansion in India, building up to 12 new factories and 

employing as many as one million workers by 2020 

 The State Government of Tamil Nadu has signed investment agreements worth Rs 2,42,160 

crore (US$ 36.45 billion) during a two-day Global Investors Meet in September 2015.

Government Initiatives 

In a bid to push the 'Make in India' initiative to the global level, Mr Narendra Modi, Prime Minister 

of India, pitched India as a manufacturing destination at the World International Fair in Germany's 

Hannover earlier this year. Mr Modi showcased India as a business friendly destination to attract 

foreign businesses to invest and manufacture in the country. 

The Government of India has taken several initiatives to promote a healthy environment for the 

growth of manufacturing sector in the country. Some of the notable initiatives and developments are: 

 The Government plans to organise a ‗Make in India week‘ in Mumbai between February 13-

18, 2016 to boost the ‗Make in India‘ initiative and expects 1,000 companies from 10 key 

sectors to participate in the exhibition of innovative products and processes, a hackathon and 

sessions on urban planning, among other events. 

 The National Institution for Transforming India Aayog (NITI Aayog) plans to release a 

blueprint for various technological interventions which need to be incorporated by the Indian 

manufacturing economy, with a view to have a sustainable edge over competing neighbours 

like Bangladesh and Vietnam over the long term. 

 Ms Nirmala Sitharaman, Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Commerce and Industry, 

has launched the Technology Acquisition and Development Fund (TADF) under the National 

Manufacturing Policy (NMP) to facilitate acquisition of Clean, Green and Energy Efficient 

Technologies, by Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). 

 The Government of India has asked New Delhi's envoys in over 160 countries to focus on 

economic diplomacy to help government attract investment and transform the 'Make in India' 

campaign a success to boost growth during the annual heads of missions conference. Prime 

Minister, Mr Modi has also utilised the opportunity to brief New Delhi's envoys about the 

Government's Foreign Policy priority and immediate focus on restoring confidence of foreign 

investors and augmenting foreign capital inflow to increase growth in manufacturing sector. 

 The Government of Uttar Pradesh (UP) has secured investment deals valued at Rs 5,000 

crore (US$ 752.58 million) for setting up mobile manufacturing units in the state. 

 The Government of Maharashtra has cleared land allotment for 130 industrial units across the 

state with an investment of Rs 6,266 crore (US$ 943.13 million) 

 Dr Jitendra Singh, Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of 

Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances 

& Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Government of India, has announced the 'Make in 

Northeast' initiative beginning with a comprehensive tourism plan for the region. 

 Government of India has planned to invest US$ 10 billion in two semiconductor plants in 

order to facilitate electronics manufacturing in the country. 

 Entrepreneurs of small-scale businesses in India will soon be able to avail loans under 

Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY). The three products available under the PMMY 

include: Shishu - covering loans up to Rs 50,000 (US$ 752), Kishor - covering loans between 

Rs 50,000 (US$ 752) to Rs 0.5 million (US$ 7,520), and Tarun - covering loans between Rs 

0.5 million (US$ 7,520) and Rs 1 million (US$ 15,052). 

Road Ahead 

The Government of India has an ambitious plan to locally manufacture as many as 181 products. The 

move could help infrastructure sectors such as power, oil and gas, and automobile manufacturing that 



 

Page 139 of 371 

 

require large capital expenditure and revive the Rs 1,85,000 crore (US$ 28.42 billion) Indian capital 

goods business. 

India is an attractive hub for foreign investments in the manufacturing sector. Several mobile phone, 

luxury and automobile brands, among others, have set up or are looking to establish their 

manufacturing bases in the country. 

With impetus on developing industrial corridors and smart cities, the government aims to ensure 

holistic development of the nation. The corridors would further assist in integrating, monitoring and 

developing a conducive environment for the industrial development and will promote advance 

practices in manufacturing.

INDIAN CHEMICAL INDUSTRY 

Introduction 

Chemical industry is one of the oldest industries in India.  The industry, including petrochemicals, 

and alcohol-based chemicals, has grown at a pace outperforming the overall growth of the industry. 

The Indian chemical industry is at the threshold of rapid growth with the Government of India 

providing an atmosphere of support and encouragement. India's vibrant chemical and petrochemical 

industry plays a significant role in the economic development of our country. In terms of volume, 

the Indian chemical industry is the 6th largest in the world and the 3rd largest in Asia, with the size 

worth $108.4 billion. 

The Chemicals Industry comprises both small and large scale units. The fiscal  concessions granted 

to small sector in mid-eighties led to establishment of large number of units in the Small Scale 

Industry (SSI) sector. Currently, the Indian Chemical Industry is in the midst of major restructuring 

and consolidation phase. With the shift in emphasis on product innovation, brand building and 

environmental friendliness, this industry is increasingly moving towards greater customer-

orientation. Even though India enjoys an abundant supply of basic raw materials, it will have to 

build upon technical services and marketing capabilities to face global competition and increase its 

share of exports. 

Overview 

The Indian chemical industry has witnessed robust growth in the past decade and has been ranked 6th 

largest in the world and 3rd largest in the Asia according to United Nations Industrial Development 

Organisation (UNIDO). The industry has been forecast to reach USD 200 billion mark by 2020.  

Strong domestic demand, driven by increasing purchasing power parity in the country, is one of the 

main pillars of Indian manufacturing sector, and India is expected to maintain the healthy growth in 

the years to come. India‘s geographic location provides easy access to the world markets; and low 

cost advantage, availability of talent pool and skilled manpower make India the destination of choice.  

Indian government is rendering extensive support to give impetus to the Indian chemical industry and 

has set up the task force to consider suggestions for National Chemical Policy to ensure steady 

growth of the country‘s chemical sector.  

India is the 13th largest country in terms of ethylene capacity and proposes enhancing the refining 

capacity to 300 mmtpa in 2017 from the current 190 mmtpa. India is emerging as Asia‘s refining hub 

and become the net exporter of petrochemicals to countries like the Middle East, Korea, Japan and 

http://www.ibef.org/

Singapore. 

Indian government has set ambitious plans to set up Petroleum Chemicals & Petrochemicals 

Investment Regions (PCPIR) in Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and Odisha to accelerate 

country‘s industrial growth. 

The Indian government has earmarked substantial funds to achieve healthy growth of country‘s 

upstream and downstream sectors of the chemical industry. During the 11th Five-Year Plan, Indian 

government reserved INR 0.626 trillion for refining and marketing sectors and increase that to INR

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INDIAN CHEMICAL INDUSTRY 

 High Domestic Demand Potential 

 Focus on new segments such as specialty and knowledge chemicals 

 Gujarat and Maharashtra have emerged as most favoured zones 

 Fragmented Industry 

 Increase in focus on Research and Development 

As on 2015, the National Chemical Policy of India which is expected to help in improving the 

chemical industry is in final stages and as a part of this, the Government is planning to launch Indian 

Bureau of Corrosion Control and setting up National Chemical Centre that could prevent losses from 

corrosion and act as a repository information Center for the chemical industry. 

Strong economic growth and rise in per-capita income has meant a steady increase in demand for 

chemicals expected to clock a growth of 10-13 per cent over the coming years. The industry has left 

behind a low-growth and regulated environment to emerge more mature.  

There is strong government support towards R&D; this would benefit the sector, In 2015, Department

INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES  

Agro-Chemicals 

India is the third largest producer of agro-chemicals globally. India exports about 50% of its current 

production and exports are likely to remain a key component of the industry.  

Specialty Chemicals 

The specialty chemicals market has witnessed a growth of 14% in the last five years; the market size 

is expected to reach USD 70 Billion by 2020. India is currently the world‘s third largest consumer of 

polymers and growth in plastic demand will drive up consumption further. Growth drivers include a 

growing construction industry and adoption of advanced coating, ceiling and polymer-based 

reinforcing material in construction as well as plastics, paints and coatings for the automotive sector.  

Colourant Chemicals 

The Indian colourant industry is valued at USD 6.8 Billion, with exports accounting for nearly 75%. 

India accounts for 16% of global industry share and this figure is expected to further increase. Other 

segments include petrochemicals, bio-pharma, bio-agri, and bio-industrial products.  

(Source: A Brief Report on Chemical and Petrochemical Industry in India, April 2015, Corporate 

Catalyst (India) Private Limited – www.cci.in)  

CHALLENGES FACED BY INDIAN CHEMICAL INDUSTRY 

India's high inflation rate and rising prices, weakening business and consumer sentiment and the 

complicated access to lending pose a greater threat to the chemical and petrochemical sector. Raw 

materials are difficult to procure and expensive due to the lack of adequate facilities at ports and 

railways. Many manufacturing plants need to be upgraded and made more environmentally friendly. 

Lack of business confidence, policy paralysis, poor infrastructure, and a difficult business 

environment are some of the reasons for no major petrochemicals foreign direct investment (FDI)] in 

India. In order to attract multinationals to invest in India, major structural and policy changes are 

required. India's chemical sector spends 1-2% of its turnover on R&D, compared to 5-10% in 

developed countries. The sector's high resource dependence is a major threat to its stability. Inputs 

roughly account for 80% of final outputs, which makes profit margins highly dependent on input 

prices. Other challenges include low capacity utilisation and a shortage of skilled workforce. 

(Source: A Brief Report on Chemical and Petrochemical Industry in India, April 2015, Corporate 

Catalyst (India) Private Limited – www.cci.in)  

ADVANTAGE INDIA 

Robust demand 

 A large population, dependence on agriculture, and strong export demand are the key growth 

drivers for the chemicals industry. 

 Per-capita consumption of chemicals in India is lower relative to Western peers and there 

exists a large latent demand.

2012, March 31, 2011. 

"The financial statements are prepared and presented under the historical cost convention and 

evaluated on a going-concern basis using the accrual system of accounting in accordance with the 

accounting principles generally accepted in India (Indian GAAP) and the requirements of the 

Companies Act, 1956 (up to March 31, 2014), and notified sections, schedules and rules of the 

Companies Act 2013 (with effect from April 01, 2014), including the Accounting Standards as

are recognized in the period in which results are known/materialized."  

(C) Significant Accounting Policies :

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Indian GAAP requires management to 

make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 

and disclosure of contingent liabilities on the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of 

revenue and expenses during the reported period. Although these estimates are based on 

management‘s best knowledge of current events and actions, uncertainty about these assumptions and 

estimates could result in the outcomes requiring a material adjustment to the Carrying amounts of 

Assets or Liabilities in future periods. 

(b) Fixed Assets : 

Fixed Assets are stated at their acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. 

Cost comprises of all costs incurred to bring the assets to their location and working condition up to 

the date the assets are put to use where applicable together with any incidental expenses of 

acquisition/installation. Cost of acquisition includes borrowing costs that are directly attributable to 

the acquisition/construction of qualifying assets.

2013 except non charging of 100% depreciation on assets costing below Rs. 5000/-. The carrying 

amount as on April 1st, 2015 is depreciated over the balance useful life of asset.  

 Depreciation on additions to the assets and the assets sold or disposed off, during the year is provided 

on prorata basis, at their respective useful life or rate of depreciation as prescribed with reference to 

the date of acquisition / installation or date of sale / disposal.

collection. Revenue from sale of goods is recognized on delivery of the products, when all significant 

contractual obligations have been satisfied, the property in the goods is transferred for price,

MANAGEMENT‟S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

AND RESULTS OF OPERATION 

The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in 

conjunction with our restated financial statements for the period ended January 31, 2016 and financial 

years ended March 31, 2015, March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2013 prepared in accordance with the 

Companies Act and Indian GAAP and restated in accordance with the SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, 

including the schedules, annexure and notes thereto and the reports thereon, included in the section titled 

―Financial Statements as Restated ‖ on page 187 of this Draft Prospectus. 

Indian GAAP differs in certain material aspects from U.S. GAAP and IFRS. We have not attempted to 

quantify the impact of IFRS or U.S. GAAP on the financial data included in this Draft Prospectus, nor do 

we provide reconciliation of our financial statements to those under U.S. GAAP or IFRS. Accordingly, 

the degree to which the Indian GAAP financial statements included in this Draft Prospectus will provide 

meaningful information is entirely dependent on the reader‘s level of familiarity with the Companies Act, 

Indian GAAP and SEBI ICDR Regulations. 

This discussion contains forward-looking statements and reflects our current views with respect to future

proportionate basis i.e. the total number of Shares applied for in that category multiplied by 

the inverse of the over subscription ratio (number of Applicants in the category x number of 

Shares applied for). 

(b) The number of Shares to be allocated to the successful Applicants will be arrived at on a 

proportionate basis in marketable lots (i.e. Total number of Shares applied for into the inverse

(e) If the Shares allotted on a proportionate basis to any category is more than the Shares allotted 

to the Applicants in that category, the balance available Shares or allocation shall be first 

adjusted against any category, where the allotted Shares are not sufficient for proportionate 

allotment to the successful Applicants in that category, the balance Shares, if any, remaining 

after such adjustment will be added to the category comprising Applicants applying for the 

minimum number of Shares. If as a result of the process of rounding off to the nearest 

multiple of 6,000 Equity Shares, results in the actual allotment being higher than the shares 

offered, the final allotment may be higher at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, up 

to 110% of the size of the offer specified under the Capital Structure mentioned in this Draft 

Prospectus.

subject to the reservation for Retail individual Applicants as described below:

entitled to more than fifty per cent on proportionate basis, the retail individual investors 

shall be allocated that higher percentage.

• individual applicants other than retails individual investors and

RESTRICTIONS ON FOREIGN OWNERSHIP OF INDIAN SECURITIES 

Foreign investment in Indian securities is regulated through the Industrial Policy, 1991 of the Government 

of India and Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (―FEMA‖). While the Industrial Policy, 1991 

prescribes the limits and the conditions subject to which foreign investment can be made in different 

sectors of the Indian economy, FEMA regulates the precise manner in which such investment may be 

made. Under the Industrial Policy, unless specifically restricted, foreign investment is freely permitted in 

all sectors of Indian economy up to any extent and without any prior approvals, but the foreign investor is 

required to follow certain prescribed procedures for making such investment.  

The Government of India, from time to time, has made policy pronouncements on Foreign Direct 

Investment (―FDI‖) through press notes and press releases. The Department of Industrial Policy and 

Promotion, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, of the Government of India (―DIPP‖) has issued 

consolidated FDI Policy, which with effect from May 12, 2015, consolidates and supersedes all previous 

press notes, press releases and clarifications on FDI issued by the DIPP that were in force and effect as on 

May 12, 2015. Further, DIIP has issued a press note dated November 10, 2015 which introduces a few 

changes in the consolidated FDI Policy issued on May 12, 2015. The Government usually update the 

consolidated circular on FDI Policy once every Year and therefore, FDI Policy of 2015 will be valid until 

the DIPP issues an updated circular.  

RBI has also issued Master Circular on Foreign Investment in India dated July 01, 2015. In terms of the 

Master Circular, an Indian company may issue fresh shares to persons resident outside India (who are 

eligible to make investments in India, for which eligibility criteria are as prescribed). Such fresh issue of 

shares shall be subject to inter-alia, the pricing guidelines prescribed under the Master Circular. The 

Indian company making such fresh issue of shares would be subject to the reporting requirements, inter-

alia with respect to consideration for issue of shares and also subject to making certain filings including 

filing of Form FC-GPR. 

Under the current consolidated FDI Policy of 2015, foreign direct investment in micro and small 

enterprises is subject to sectoral caps, entry routes and other sectoral regulations. At present 100% foreign 

direct investment through automatic route is permitted in the sector in which our Company operates. 

The transfer of shares between an Indian resident and a Non-resident does not require prior approval of 

FIPB or RBI, subject to fulfilment of certain conditions as specified by DIPP / RBI, from time to time. 

Such conditions include (i) the activities of the investee company are under the automatic route under the 

FDI Policy and the non-resident shareholding is within the sectorial limits under the FDI policy; and (ii) 

the pricing is in accordance with the guidelines prescribed by the SEBI/RBI. Investors are advised to refer 

to the exact text of the relevant statutory provisions of law before investing and / or subsequent purchase 

or sale transaction in the Equity Shares of Our Company. 

The Equity Shares have not been and will not be registered under the U.S Securities Act of 1933, as 

amended (“U.S. Securities Act”) or any state securities laws in the United States and may not be 

offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. Persons (as 

defined in Regulation S of the U.S. Securities Act), except pursuant to exemption from, or in a 

transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable 

state securities laws.  

Accordingly the Equity Shares are being offered and sold only outside the United States in offshore 

transaction in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S Securities Act and the applicable laws of the 

jurisdiction where those offers and sale occur. However the Equity Shares have not been and will 

not be registered, listed or otherwise qualified in any other jurisdiction outside India and may not 

be offered or sold, and Applications may not be made by persons in any such jurisdiction, except in 

compliance with the applicable laws of such jurisdiction. The above information is given for the 

benefit of the Applicants. Our Company and the LM are not liable for any amendments or 

modification or changes in applicable laws or regulations, which may occur after the date of the 

Prospectus. Applicants are advised to make their independent investigations and ensure that the 

Applications are not in violation of the laws or regulations applicable to them
